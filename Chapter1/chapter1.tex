\section{Introduction}

\label{introduction}
A handful of different fusion fuels were discussed in the opening chapter. The cross-section and Q-value of the D-T reaction make a burning plasma the most easily realisable. However, sustainably liberating energy from the D-T fusion reaction requires a reliable supply of tritium fuel. Given tritium is not naturally occuring, with a $t_{\frac{1}{2}}=12.3y$ \nomenclature[a]{$t_{\frac{1}{2}}$}{Half-life} it must be artificially produced. It is worth considering whether this could be outsourced to a third party given the complexity of `grow-your-own'. The HWR reactors of Canada, Romania and the Republic of Korea produce small amounts of tritium each year, but significantly less than is required for the operation of a fusion power plant. In fact, these facilities will struggle to provide the relatively small amounts of tritium necessary for the start-up of a device \cite{Kovari2018}. Given that, future plant must be tritium self-sufficient. Neutrons will initiate tritium producing reactions in $^{6,7}$Li contained within a blanket. Depending on the blanket design, the tritium will either be purged or natually `outgas' before filtration and storage. 

The ratio of tritium produced to tritium consumed is known as the Tritium Breeding Ratio (TBR). An equation for the TBR is given as equation~\ref{eq:tbr} where $T_{prod}$ is tritons produced in the blanket, $T_{cons}$ tritons consumed in the plasma, $N_{s}$ the number density of each nuclide, $\sigma_{r}$ the r\textsuperscript{th} tritium producing reaction cross-section for that nuclide and $\phi(E)$ the neutron flux as a function of energy. 

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:tbr}
  \mathrm{TBR} = \frac{T_{prod}}{T_{cons}} = \frac{\sum_{s=1}^{S} N_{s}}{T_{cons}} \int_{0}^{\infty} \phi(E) \sum_{r=1}^{R} \sigma_{r}(E) dE
\end{equation}

Two reactions in lithium produce the majority of tritium in the blanket and are shown below. Both naturally occuring lithium isotopes have an anomolously low nuclear binding energy per nucleon. This is why \textsuperscript{6}Li can exothermically fission despite being such a light nuclide. With the reaction being exothermic, its likelihood gains with decreasing interaction energy, meaning neutrons of all energies may potentially contribute to tritium production. Conversely, the tritium producing \textsuperscript{7}Li reaction is endothermic, with a threshold interaction energy of approximately 2.47 MeV. Natural lithium is $\approx 7.5\%$ \textsuperscript{6}Li with the remainder \textsuperscript{7}Li. Fusion breeding blankets will need their \textsuperscript{6}Li to be isotopically enriched to achieve an acceptable TBR.

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
  ^{6}\mathrm{Li} + \mathrm{n} & \rightarrow \alpha + \mathrm{T} + 4.8\mathrm{MeV} \\
  ^{7}\mathrm{Li} + \mathrm{n} & \rightarrow \alpha + \mathrm{T} + \mathrm{n} - 2.5\mathrm{MeV}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

There are other reactions for creating tritons. For instance, the tritium decay product, $^{3}\mathrm{He}$ has an affinity for thermal neutrons and can be transmuted back to tritium by them. There is also a small chance of neutron capture leading to tritium production in $^{10}\mathrm{B}$.

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
  ^{3}\mathrm{He} + \mathrm{n} & \rightarrow p + \mathrm{T} \\
  ^{10}\mathrm{B} + \mathrm{n} & \rightarrow 2\alpha + \mathrm{T}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

There also a variety of multi-step pathways which produce tritium via the creation of other intermediate nuclides. 

Within all proposed breeding systems there are a variety of tritium loss mechanisms: absorption in materials, leakage in the tritium extraction system and radioactive decay. To accommodate these losses and still retain a TBR in excess of unity, a margin, $M$ is employed: $\mathrm{TBR} = 1 + M$. There is a constraint on the maximum allowable tritium inventory at a given facility on the order of kilograms. The window of adequate tritium supply is therefore relatively narrow and TBR should be precisely known and/or adjustable to keep within this window. Unfortunately there are many sources of uncertainty within TBR calculations. These can broadly be categorised as: poor/missing nuclear data, modelling simplifications and Monte-Carlo statistical uncertainty. Nuclear data often contributes the greatest uncertainty to TBR \cite{El-Guebaly2009}. However, the effect of these uncertainties is rarely reported alongside calculated TBR values. This is in large part due to the difficulty of propagating uncertainty data through a Monte-Carlo radiation transport simulation to the uncertainty on integral quantities of interest. Any uncertainties that are propagated are generally based on a simplified uncertainty treatment that does not include full energy, emitted double-differential and channel-to-channel correlations. 
% ^^ needs cleaning up - does it flow in terms of concepts?

A sensitivity analysis of Helium Cooled Lithium Lead (HCLL) \nomenclature[z]{HCLL}{Helium Cooled Lithium Lead} type breeder blankets for the ITER Test Blanket Modules (TBM) \nomenclature[z]{TBM}{Test Blanket Module} has identified $^{6}$Li, $^{56}$Fe and the Pb cross-sections as the most important for TBR uncertainty \cite{Leichtle2011}. This chapter quantifies the TBR uncertainty introduced by Pb nuclear data on the HCLL DEMO blanket design by employing the Total Monte Carlo (TMC) \nomenclature[z]{TMC}{Total Monte Carlo} uncertainty propagation methodology.

\subsection{Literature review}
\subsubsection{Nuclear data}
Nuclear data (ND) is the general term for nuclear physics quantified and recorded for later retrieval. Once experimental nuclear interaction findings are produced, they are typically submitted to and stored in the EXFOR database. This is a publically queryable dataset of experiments to date. While the EXFOR dataset covers many nuclides, reaction channels and energies, this parameter space is very large and expensive to explore with nuclear physics experiments. In some instances, for example with short-lived radioisotopes such as metastables, it is not possible to peform the appropriate experiment. In this case, any exant experimental data is augmented with information derived from theoretical nuclear physics models. These data, from experiment and theory are used to develop or `evaluate' a bundle of nuclear data typically grouped by incident projectile and target nuclide. The evaluated files include likelihoods of interaction for various reactants (cross-sections) but also reaction product energy spectra, angular distributions, decay data, uncertainty information and more. There is a globally standard format known as Evaluated Nuclear Data File (ENDF) \nomenclature[z]{ENDF}{Evaluated Nuclear Data File} which specifies the scope, layout and precision of these files. The current version of the ENDF format is ENDF-6 \cite{}. As well as the reaction information listed above and detailed below, the files also contain information on contributing experiments and modifications which occurred during data evaluation. There are a series of different nuclear data libraries which constitute different attempts to capture and record the nuclear behaviour of a variety of nuclides. These may be general purpose (e.g. the confusingly named ENDF/B \cite{brown2018} \nomenclature[z]{ENDF/B}{Evalulated Nuclear Data File B}, JENDL \cite{shibata2011} \nomenclature[z]{JENDL}{Japanese Evaluated Nuclear Data Library} and TENDL \cite{Rochman2016} \nomenclature[z]{TENDL}{TALYS-based Evalulated Nuclear Data Library} ) or more specialist (e.g. EAF \cite{packer2011} \nomenclature[z]{EAF}{European Activation File}). Many countries with nuclear programmes have developed their own nuclear data libraries over time. 

ENDF type files are typically stored as ASCII \nomenclature[z]{ASCII}{American Standard Code for Information Interchange} text. They are arranged hierarchically as displayed in figure~\ref{fig:endf}. The MAT or material is typically but not exclusively a nuclide, it can also be elemental or even compound in nature. A MAT code is a unique reference for a material, such as 125 for \textsuperscript{1}H or 7443 for \textsuperscript{186}W. Each material contains several `files' referred to by an MF number. These contain the data listed in the sections below. Each MF, or file, is split into MTs. 

\begin{figure}[ht]
%  \figuretitle{}
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{endf_architecture}
  \caption{The layout of an ENDF `tape', containing materials (typically only one material per tape), which contain files, which contain sections, which contain records.}
  \label{fig:endf}
\end{figure}

Nuclear data `processing' is required to turn the contents of an ENDF formatted file into a form that radiation transport and activation-transmutation codes can use. This is accomplished with a code such as NJOY \cite{} or PREPRO \cite{}.

\paragraph{Resonance parameters}
The cross-section as a function of interaction energy is often an irregular, unsmooth shape due to the presence of nuclear resonances. These resonances are compound nuclei. That is, compound nuclear reactions where a compound nucleus is temporarily formed. These nuclear resonances occur because the nucleus is a quantum mechanical system, with certain, discrete energy levels permitted. Methods for predicting nuclear reactions based on forces within the nucleus remain a work in progress as the inter-nucleon forces inside the nucleus are too complex to currently model, especially for larger nuclei. Insights can however still be gained from `black-box' models of the nucleus, where internal understanding is not assumed. One such approach is the R-Matrix interaction framework. In the this method, unknown internal properties are parameters which can be deduced by comparison with experimental results. It can be performed to varying degrees of complexity, with or without particle spin dependence, multiple reaction channels, etc. Other resonance formalisms are typically simplifications of the R-Matrix approach.

Rather than trying to record the cross-section for all interaction energies in a tabulated way, it is easier to reconstruct cross-sections from some `background' ($\sigma$, E) tuples and a series of summed resonance curves parameterised by resonance theory. These curves have a functional description, dependent on energy with various parameters determining their shape. This Breit-Wigner distribution is shown as equation~\ref{eq:breit-wigner}. 

\begin{equation}
  \sigma(E) = \frac{4\pi\lambdabar^{2}(2J + 1)}{(2s_{a} + 1)(2s_{b} + 1)}  \frac{\Gamma^{2}/4}{[(E-E_{R})^{2} + \Gamma^{2}/4]}
  \label{eq:breit-wigner}
\end{equation}

Along with the independent variable energy, $E$, the parameters include resonance `widths', $\Gamma$; resonance energy, $E_{R}$; angular momentum, $J$, and spin, $s_{a}$ and $s_{b}$ \cite{}. Consider a neutron field of a given energy incident on a block of material, the interaction energy distribution is dependent on the temperature of this material (higher temperatures act to widen the spread of interaction energies). As such, resonances are Doppler broadened as material temperature increases. An advantage of reconstructing cross-sections from resonance parameters is that the temperature dependence of cross-sections can be handled in an elegant way. 

While many resonances are detectable by experimental methods, at higher energies it becomes difficult to distinguish between neighbouring resonances. This is the transition from the Resolved Resonance Range (RRR) \nomenclature[z]{RRR}{Resolved Resonance Range} to the Unresolved Resonance Range (URR) \nomenclature[z]{URR}{Unresolved Resonance Range}. However resonances in this region are still important for self-shielding effects (see chapter~\ref{chap:group_structure}). As such, in the URR distributions of expected resonance widths and energies are given instead of experimentally derived data.

Resonance parameters are stored within the MF=2 file of an ENDF formatted entry. 

\paragraph{Cross-sections}
As explored above, it is beneficial to encode the cross-sections of resonant reactions in a parameterised way. Compared with a simple list of ($\sigma$, E) tuples it is more insightful and permits the reconstruction of cross-sections from resonance data for different material temperatures. However, past a certain point, resonances overlap to form a continuum and this schema is no longer practical or useful. For this high energy range then, where cross-sections change relatively slowly as a function of energy, simple tabulated data is used. This cross-section information is recorded in MF=3 with a single MT for each open reaction channel. For instance, MF=3, MT=102 is \textsuperscript{i}X(n,$\gamma$)\textsuperscript{i}X for nuclide \textsuperscript{i}X. Where cross-sections reconstructed from resonance parameters do not match, corrections are also recorded here.

Cross-section uncertainties can be represented as single values for a given energy and reaction channel. As an example, the $^{208}$Pb(n,2n)$^{207}$Pb reaction at 14MeV is shown in Table \ref{tab:lead_by_lib} for a variety of nuclear data libraries. Information on how uncertainty for a given energy affects other energies is quantified in energy covariance matrices, but these are not available for the majority of reaction channels in standard nuclear data libraries.

The TENDL-2015 library is a comprehensive, general-purpose nuclear data library which contains data on interactions between 7 projectiles and over 2,800 target nuclides. The library is produced by a suite of codes known as T6 and an adherance to a strict methodology of reproducability \cite{Rochman2016}. It uses the TALYS nuclear reaction code to model reactions and predict nuclear data. The inputs are fundamental parameters, including data from the RIPL-3 database \cite{RIPL3}, each with their own probability distributions that reflect their uncertainties. For the TENDL libraries, the distribution of nuclear data contained in the files with sampled input parameters can give more information on nuclear data uncertainty than is contained in a traditional evaluated nuclear data file. The shape of the distribution are captured and need not necessarily be simple Gaussian.

The Total Monte-Carlo (TMC) method utilises nuclear data generated from these sampled fundamental parameters to quantify uncertainties on integral quantities. With a given ensemble of sampled nuclear data, a radiation transport simulation is performed and an observable recorded. The process is repeated hundreds of times to produce a distribution of the observable of interest, with the uncertainty in the fundamental parameters used in the genration of self-consistent nuclear data files, propagating the fully-correlated variations to the observable PDF \cite{Koning2008}.

\subsection{Input nuclear data}
\label{sec:data}
It is instructive to inspect the nuclear data used as input for this TMC simulation. In an unmoderated fusion neutron spectrum the dominant reaction channels for Pb are neutron multiplication (n,2n) and elastic scattering, at approximately 2 and 3 barns respectively.

\end{table}

Figure \ref{fig:tendl_n2n} and Table \ref{table:n2n} show the distributions of TENDL-2015 cross-sections for (n,2n) at 14MeV. Lower values for $\sigma_{n,2n}$ will reduce the neutron multiplication of the blanket and, other quantities being equal, result in a reduced total neutron flux and therefore a lower TBR.

This may or may not be representative of the underlying distribution.

\end{figure}

The elastic scattering data shown in Figure \ref{fig:tendl_nel} and Table \ref{table:nel} are instead positively skewed, with high value tails for each isotope, with the most pronounced tail being $^{208}$Pb. A greater elastic scattering cross-section will result in an increased likelihood of downscattering neutrons to lower energies. The softer spectrum will increase triton production in $^{6}$Li as the cross-section increases with decreasing energy, i.e. $\sigma_{n,t}(E) \propto \frac{1}{E}$. However, the elastic scattering cross-section is anti-correlated with the n,2n cross-section in the TENDL data (see figure \ref{fig:pb_el_n2n_corr}). In other words, a high scatter cross-section is typically coupled with a low multiplicity cross-section. This compensating effect decreases the overall uncertainty where individual perturbations on a single channel would result in an unrealistic, larger uncertainty. This inclusion of cross-channel correlation is one of the key advantages of TMC over more traditional uncertainty propagation (UP) methods.

\section{Method}
The sampled nuclear data files were downloaded in both ACE (293K) and ENDF format from the TENDL-2015 website \cite{TENDL2015}. Figure \ref{fig:tendl_lead} shows the (n,2n) cross-sections as a function of energy for $^{208}$Pb.

  \label{fig:tendl_lead}
\end{figure}

The ENDF utility code Inter was used to extract cross-section values at a given energy from the ENDF files. The resulting distributions and correlations were plotted as figures \ref{fig:tendl_n2n}, \ref{fig:tendl_nel} \& \ref{fig:pb_el_n2n_corr}. Figures \ref{fig:tendl_n2n} and \ref{fig:tendl_nel} were examined for their first 3 statistical moments. 

An 11.25\degree \ 2014 DEMO HCLL MCNP model was modified to tally TBR. The particle count was set to $3\cdot10^{6}$ giving a TBR relative standard deviation, RSD $\approx 0.002$ for each simulation. This is negligible compared to the total (nuclear data \& statistics) accumulated RSD and so the variance of the observable is assumed to be entirely due to variance in the nuclear data. While other TMC analyses have separated out the Monte-Carlo statistical variations to limit the computational cost \cite{Rochman2014a}, in this work the statistical variation has been strictly limited to avoid this issue. Whilst the Pb nuclear data employed was from TENDL-2015, FENDL3.1b data was used for the neutron transport of other elements present in the reactor model. A series of simple Bash and Python scripts were used to select different Pb TENDL-2015 ACE files for different runs, before creating and submitting jobs to the local cluster.

Python scripts were used to plot TBR convergence as a function of simulation count (see figure \ref{fig:convergence}) and the distributions of simulated TBR (see figure \ref{fig:tbr_distribution}).

\section{Results \& discussion}

The TMC simulation was run for a total of 1559 MCNP simulations, each 84 core-minutes across 32 cores. The total wall-clock time was 3 days, 15 hours.

\begin{figure}[ht]
%  \figuretitle{}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{hcll_convergence_1559}
	\caption{The mean and standard deviation of the TBR distribution is presented as a function of the number of simulations. The TMC simulation can be seen to converge at approximately 400 MCNP runs. $\mu(400) \approx 1.02$ and $\sigma(400) \approx 1.14$.}
	\label{fig:convergence}
\end{figure}

The mean TBR value is 1.0193 whilst the median is 1.0200, with a one sigma standard deviation of 0.012 or 1.2\% of the mean. The TBR distribution is approximately normal, with a small skewness of -0.199, meaning the low-value TBR tail is longer than the high-value tail. Figure \ref{fig:tbr_n2n} shows the expected correlation between the n,2n cross-sections used in a given simulation and the TBR attained in that simulation.

	\caption{Above are scatter plots of average cross-sections for the n,2n (left) and elastic (right) channels against resulting TBR value. As the cross-sections for each of the three lead isotopes were varied in every simulation, so the cross-sections plotted here are the elemental average values denoted as $\bar{\sigma}_{n,2n}$ or $\bar{\sigma}_{n,n'}$, i.e. all three varied Pb isotopes contribute, weighted by their relative natural abundances. The n,2n cross-section is positively correlated with the TBR value as expected. There is less of a relationship between scattering and TBR.}

Uncertainty propagation in Monte-Carlo type radiation transport problems has often previously been computed using linear perturbation theory approaches. Unfortunately these are only applicable for small changes in the input data. They are also unable to reproduce probability distributions of the integral quantity of interest \cite{Rising2012}. Whilst figure \ref{fig:tbr_distribution} shows a TBR distribution that is not tremendously skewed, that is not to say other fusion quantities will not be. Koning \& Rochman have demonstrated that fast and accelerator driven fission systems can have significantly skewed k$_{\mbox{eff}}$ values, best described by an Extreme Value Fit (EVD) \cite{Koning2008}.

\section{Conclusion}
TBR uncertainty has been computed with the TMC technique, investigating the contribution of uncertain nuclear data from the three major lead isotopes. The standard deviation is 1.2\% of the mean TBR. However, note that 5.8\% of the distribution is less than unity. While the average value may appear to be feasible, it should be stressed that there is a non-negligible probability of a value below a required limit. The TBR values are relatively low as this particular model has not been optimised for TBR and any practical design should have a TBR $\approx 1.1$ \cite{Fischer2015}, but in future design studies engineers should be aware of the probability of non-compliant operational parameters. 

The TENDL-2015 nuclear data investigated in section \ref{sec:data}, which is not necessarily Gaussian in shape, has yielded a TBR distribution with a small but finite negative skewness, an extended low-value tail. It is not possible to deduce this shape with more simplified approaches to uncertainty propagation such as linear perturbation theory.

Future work on TBR in HCLL could include the effect of other nuclides and elements which TBR is sensitive to including iron, as well as a completely correlated uncertainty propagation method employing lithium. 

More generally, when solving for integral quantities in nuclear fusion systems, thought should be given to fully-correlated uncertainty propagation and the form of the resulting probability distributions. In particular, whether a non-normal distribution with increased likelihood of extreme behaviour would have engineering design or safety implications for TBR, nuclear heating, fast flux, gas production or damage terms. Moreover, in all analyses for design applications the non-negligible probability of operational parameters in unacceptable regimes should be borne in mind.
