abstract = {As nuclear fusion progresses towards a sustainable energy source and the power of tokamak devices increases, a greater understanding of the radiation fields will be required. As well as on-load radiation fields, off-load or shutdown radiation field are an important consideration for the safety and economic viability of a commercial fusion reactor. Previously codes such as MCR2S have been written in order to predict the shutdown dose rates within, and in regions surrounding, a fusion reactor. MCR2S utilises a constructive solid geometry (CSG) model and a superimposed structured mesh to calculate 3-D maps of the shutdown dose rate. A new approach to MCR2S calculations is proposed and implemented using a single unstructured mesh to replace both the CSG model and the superimposed structured mesh. This new MCR2S approach has been demonstrated on three models of increasing complexity. These models were: a sphere, the ITER computational shutdown dose rate benchmark and the DEMO computational shutdown dose rate benchmark. In each case the results were compared to MCR2S calculations performed using MCR2S with CSG geometry and a superimposed structured mesh. It was concluded that the results from the unstructured mesh implementation of MCR2S compared well to the CSG structured mesh calculations. It was found that the resolution of the unstructured mesh can significantly affect the results of the calculations, and therefore it is important to finely mesh components with streaming paths or significantly contribute to the dose rate in the areas of interest. Although computationally more expensive it was found that there are some clear advantages when using unstructured meshes with MCR2S calculations which are outlined in this paper.},

abstract = {Correct multigroup cross sections are essential to modeling the physics of nuclear reactors. In particular, the presence of resonances leads to the well-known self-shielding effect that complicates any procedure for obtaining group cross sections. The Bondarenko method for producing self-shielded group cross sections is widely used. For heterogeneous systems, the approach requires the use of an escape cross section that captures the probability that a neutron will leave a cell without interaction, and simple approximations are typically used for this purpose. Here we provide a concise derivation for how to determine group cross sections using the Bondarenko method with an extension to multi-region collision probability models. The accuracy of the method is demonstrated by comparing group cross sections derived this way with those produced by Monte Carlo simulations of thermal and fast spectrum reactors. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Kodeli2001,
abstract = {In the nuclear industry, an increased demand exists to provide modeling results with credible confidence bounds not only for simple but also for refined modeling. With the objective to facilitate and promote such analysis, a user-friendly and complete computer code package was developed comprising the multidimensional cross-section sensitivity and uncertainty code package SUSD3D, the secondary angular distribution (SAD) covariance data-processing module ERRORR34, and the cross-section covariance matrix library ZZ-VITAMIN-J/COVA. The discrete ordinates sensitivity formulation of the first-order perturbation theory is implemented in the SUSD3D code. Much effort was devoted to mitigate some drawbacks of the discrete ordinates-based sensitivity analysis, in particular to allow the analysis of complex geometries and to reduce memory requirements. The SUSD3D code is linked via interface files to a wide range of state-of-the-art transport codes suitable for complex radiation transport and facility design studies (like ANISN, DOT-3.5, DANTSYS, DORT, and TORT) and supports the new cross-section and covariance data formats. The SAD and secondary energy distribution effects can be taken into account. The complete SAD covariance matrices, as available in the European Fusion File evaluations (EFF-2 and -3) can be treated. The computer codes are written in FORTRAN-77 and run under DOS (PC), UNIX (workstations), VMS (VAX), and other compatible operating systems. The code system is extensively used to study fission- and fusion-related problems. The validation and several practical applications of the package are presented, including the reactor pressure vessel surveillance uncertainty studies, and ASPIS-iron, VENUS-3, and FNG benchmark experiment analyses.},

abstract = {We describe the physics and data included in the Reference Input Parameter Library, which is devoted to input parameters needed in calculations of nuclear reactions and nuclear data evaluations. Advanced modelling codes require substantial numerical input, therefore the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has worked extensively since 1993 on a library of validated nuclear-model input parameters, referred to as the Reference Input Parameter Library (RIPL). A final RIPL coordinated research project (RIPL-3) was brought to a successful conclusion in December 2008, after 15 years of challenging work carried out through three consecutive IAEA projects. The RIPL-3 library was released in January 2009, and is available on the Web through http://www-nds.iaea.org/RIPL-3/. This work and the resulting database are extremely important to theoreticians involved in the development and use of nuclear reaction modelling (ALICE, EMPIRE, GNASH, UNF, TALYS) both for theoretical research and nuclear data evaluations. The numerical data and computer codes included in RIPL-3 are arranged in seven segments: MASSES contains ground-state properties of nuclei for about 9000 nuclei, including three theoretical predictions of masses and the evaluated experimental masses of Audi et al. (2003). DISCRETE LEVELS contains 117 datasets (one for each element) with all known level schemes, electromagnetic and $\gamma$-ray decay probabilities available from ENSDF in October 2007. NEUTRON RESONANCES contains average resonance parameters prepared on the basis of the evaluations performed by Ignatyuk and Mughabghab. OPTICAL MODEL contains 495 sets of phenomenological optical model parameters defined in a wide energy range. When there are insufficient experimental data, the evaluator has to resort to either global parameterizations or microscopic approaches. Radial density distributions to be used as input for microscopic calculations are stored in the MASSES segment. LEVEL DENSITIES contains phenomenological parameterizations based on the modified Fermi gas and superfluid models and microscopic calculations which are based on a realistic microscopic single-particle level scheme. Partial level densities formulae are also recommended. All tabulated total level densities are consistent with both the recommended average neutron resonance parameters and discrete levels. GAMMA contains parameters that quantify giant resonances, experimental gamma-ray strength functions and methods for calculating gamma emission in statistical model codes. The experimental GDR parameters are represented by Lorentzian fits to the photo-absorption cross sections for 102 nuclides ranging from51V to239Pu. FISSION includes global prescriptions for fission barriers and nuclear level densities at fission saddle points based on microscopic HFB calculations constrained by experimental fission cross sections. {\textcopyright} 2009.},

abstract = {Neutron measurements using neutron activation systems are an essential part of the diagnostic system at large fusion machines such as JET and ITER. Nuclear data is used to infer the neutron yield. Consequently, high-quality nuclear data is essential for the proper determination of the neutron yield and fusion power. However, uncertainties due to nuclear data are not fully taken into account in uncertainty analysis for neutron yield calibrations using activation foils. This paper investigates the neutron yield uncertainty due to nuclear data using the so-called Total Monte Carlo Method. The work is performed using a detailed MCNP model of the JET fusion machine; the uncertainties due to the cross-sections and angular distributions in JET structural materials, as well as the activation cross-sections in the activation foils, are analysed. It is found that a significant contribution to the neutron yield uncertainty can come from uncertainties in the nuclear data. {\textcopyright} The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2017.},

These advances focus on neutron cross sections, covariances, fission product yields and decay data, and represent work by the US Cross Section Evaluation Working Group (CSEWG) in nuclear data evaluation that utilizes developments in nuclear theory, modeling, simulation, and experiment. The principal advances in the new library are: (1) An increase in the breadth of neutron reaction cross section coverage, extending from 393 nuclides to 423 nuclides; (2) Covariance uncertainty data for 190 of the most important nuclides, as documented in companion papers in this edition; (3) R-matrix analyses of neutron reactions on light nuclei, including isotopes of He, Li, and Be; (4) Resonance parameter analyses at lower energies and statistical high energy reactions for isotopes of Cl, K, Ti, V, Mn, Cr, Ni, Zr and W; (5) Modifications to thermal neutron reactions on fission products (isotopes of Mo, Tc, Rh, Ag, Cs, Nd, Sm, Eu) and neutron absorber materials (Cd, Gd); (6) Improved minor actinide evaluations for isotopes of U, Np, Pu, and Am (we are not making changes to the major actinides235,238U and239Pu at this point, except for delayed neutron data and covariances, and instead we intend to update them after a further period of research in experiment and theory), and our adoption of JENDL-4.0 evaluations for isotopes of Cm, Bk, Cf, Es, Fm, and some other minor actinides; (7) Fission energy release evaluations; (8) Fission product yield advances for fission-spectrum neutrons and 14 MeV neutrons incident on239Pu; and (9) A new decay data sublibrary. Integral validation testing of the ENDF/B-VII.1 library is provided for a variety of quantities: For nuclear criticality, the VII.1 library maintains the generally-good performance seen for VII.0 for a wide range of MCNP simulations of criticality benchmarks, with improved performance coming from new structural material evaluations, especially for Ti, Mn, Cr, Zr and W. For Be we see some improvements although the fast assembly data appear to be mutually inconsistent. Actinide cross section updates are also assessed through comparisons of fission and capture reaction rate measurements in critical assemblies and fast reactors, and improvements are evident. Maxwellian-averaged capture cross sections at 30 keV are also provided for astrophysics applications. We describe the cross section evaluations that have been updated for ENDF/B-VII.1 and the measured data and calculations that motivated the changes, and therefore this paper augments the ENDF/B-VII.0 publication. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

It is found that the excess margin in the breeding potential is not sufficient to cover all present uncertainties. Thus, the goal of attaining fuel self-sufficiency significantly restricts the allowable parameter space and design concepts. For example, the required breeding ratio can be reduced by (a) attaining high tritium fractional burnup, {\textgreater}5{\%}, in the plasma, (b) achieving very high reliability, {\textgreater}99{\%}, and very short times, {\textless}1 day, to fix failures in the tritium processing system, and (c) ensuring that nonradioactive decay losses from all subsystems are extremely low, e.g., {\textless}0.1 {\%} for the plasma exhaust processing system. The uncertainties due to nuclear data and calculational methods are found to be significant, but they a...},

@article{Capote2010,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} Owned by the authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2010. Evaluated nuclear data rather than raw experimental and theoretical information are employed in nuclear applications such as the design of nuclear energy systems. Therefore, the process by which such information is produced and ultimately used is of critical interest to the nuclear science community. This paper provides an overview of various contemporary methods employed to generate evaluated cross sections and related physical quantities such as particle emission angular distributions and energy spectra. The emphasis here is on data associated with neutron induced reaction processes, with consideration of the uncertainties in these data, and on the more recent evaluation methods, e.g., those that are based on stochastic (Monte Carlo) techniques. There is no unique way to perform such evaluations, nor are nuclear data evaluators united in their opinions as to which methods are superior to the others in various circumstances. In some cases it is not critical which approaches are used as long as there is consistency and proper use is made of the available physical information. However, in other instances there are definite advantages to using particular methods as opposed to other options. Some of these distinctions are discussed in this paper and suggestions are offered regarding fruitful areas for future research in the development of evaluation methodology.},

These analyses, Koomey and Hultman (2007); Grubler (2010), and Escobar-Rangel and L{\'{e}}v{\^{e}}que (2015), study only 26{\%} of reactors built globally between 1960 and 2010, providing an incomplete picture of the economic evolution of nuclear power construction. This study curates historical reactor-specific overnight construction cost (OCC) data that broaden the scope of study substantially, covering the full cost history for 349 reactors in the US, France, Canada, West Germany, Japan, India, and South Korea, encompassing 58{\%} of all reactors built globally. We find that trends in costs have varied significantly in magnitude and in structure by era, country, and experience. In contrast to the rapid cost escalation that characterized nuclear construction in the United States, we find evidence of much milder cost escalation in many countries, including absolute cost declines in some countries and specific eras. Our new findings suggest that there is no inherent cost escalation trend associated with nuclear technology.},

Nuclear fusion offers significant benefits in comparison with exploited energy sources, especially limitless fuel reserves, inherent nuclear safety, and negligible impact on the environment. The challenge is a high heat and neutron loading of the fusion reactors nuclear zone. The paper brings the ex-ante economic analysis of the fusion power plant model DEMO2 in terms of the cost of electricity. The model investment and operating costs are presented. The limit sales price of electricity was found using the net present value method. The levelized cost of electricity LCOE method with the inclusion of external costs is used for a comparison of selected power plant types based on the OECD statistical data and the EU ExternE project results. The comparison shows the levelized cost of electricity of fusion power plants competitive to the actual renewable resources. After internalisation of external costs, the fusion power plants should become even the second cheapest power source.},

The other important aspect of costs, the external costs which can arise from effects such as pollution, accidents and waste are also given. Fusion is found to offer the prospect of a new energy source with acceptable direct costs and very low external costs.

abstract = {The tritium required for ITER will be supplied from the CANDU production in Ontario, but while Ontario may be able to supply 8 kg for a DEMO fusion reactor in the mid-2050s, it will not be able to provide 10 kg at any realistic starting time. The tritium required to start DEMO will depend on advances in plasma fuelling efficiency, burnup fraction, and tritium processing technology. It is in theory possible to start up a fusion reactor with little or no tritium, but at an estimated cost of {\$}2 billion per kilogram of tritium saved, it is not economically sensible. Some heavy water reactor tritium production scenarios with varying degrees of optimism are presented, with the assumption that only Canada, the Republic of Korea, and Romania make tritium available to the fusion community. Results for the tritium available for DEMO in 2055 range from zero to 30 kg. CANDU and similar heavy water reactors could in theory generate additional tritium in a number of ways: (a) adjuster rods containing lithium could be used, giving 0.13 kg per year per reactor; (b) a fuel bundle with a burnable absorber has been designed for CANDU reactors, which might be adapted for tritium production; (c) tritium production could be increased by 0.05 kg per year per reactor by doping the moderator with lithium-6. If a fusion reactor is started up around 2055, governments in Canada, Argentina, China, India, South Korea and Romania will have the opportunity in the years leading up to that to take appropriate steps: (a) build, refurbish or upgrade tritium extraction facilities; (b) extend the lives of heavy water reactors, or build new ones; (c) reduce tritium sales; (d) boost tritium production in the remaining heavy water reactors. All of the alternative production methods considered have serious economic and regulatory drawbacks, and the risk of diversion of tritium or lithium-6 would also be a major concern. There are likely to be serious problems with supplying tritium for future fusion reactors.},

In these studies, experiments to measure cross sections and decay properties and simulations of the design of fission power plants, fusion devices and accelerators are included. The large amount of data required is stored in computer readable formats in data libraries and the most common of these are the general purpose files used for neutronics or transport calculations. These files also contain the standards against which most measurements are made. The other class of libraries are the special purpose ones containing decay data, fission yields and cross section data for dosimetry and activation. This paper gives examples of what data are available and describes their use for various fusion applications. The focus will be on neutron-induced activation data with examples of how the reactions of particular importance can be identified. All data should be accompanied by estimates of the uncertainty. This is best achieved by including covariance data; however, this is extremely challenging and only a subset of the available data has such uncertainty data. The general principles of how covariance matrices are used are outlined. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Therefore return of beryllium into the production cycle (recycling) will be necessary. The beryllium ore from some main deposits has uranium content inadmissible for fusion reactors. This fact raises a question on the need to develop and apply an economically acceptable technology for beryllium purification from the uranium. Practically any technological procedure with beryllium used in fusion reactors requires its detritiation. A study of tritium and helium release from irradiated beryllium at different temperatures and rates of temperature increase was performed at Kurchatov Institute.},

Bremsstrahlung losses for all of these fueis have been calculated in a general fashion which applies not only to IEC systems but also to most other fusion schemes; these calculations indicate that bremsstrahlung losses will be prohibitively large for 3He-3He, p-lB, and p-6Li reactors and will be a considerable fraction of the fusion power for D-sHe and D-D reactors. Further calculations show that it d{\&}not -ap{\&}r possible for the dense central region of a reactor-grade IEC device to maintain significantly non-Maxwe{\%}in ion distributions or to keep two different ion species at significantly different temperatures, in contradiction with earlier claims made about such systems. Since the ions form a Maxwellian distribution with a mean energy. not very much smaller than iihe electrostatic well depth, ions in the energetic tail of the distribution will be lost at rates greatly in excess of the fusion rate. Even by using one of the best electron confinement systems proposed for such devices, a polyhedral cusp magnetic field, and by making exceedingly optimistic assumptions about the performance of that confinement system, the electron losses from the machine prove to be intolerable for all fuels except perhaps DT. In order for IEC systems to be used as fusion reactors,it will be necessary to find methods to circumvent these problems.},

abstract = {Beryllium is expected to be one of the materials used in DEMO-type fusion power plants as blanket neutron multiplier for solid breeders and also in ITER as protective layer of plasma facing components. Among the aspects to be considered when dealing with Be a relevant one is its impurities content. One of the impurity reported by manufacturers is uranium, and that could represent a main source of concern, because its irradiation under fusion neutrons will lead to the formation of actinides, such as plutonium. The paper presents a parametric assessment utilizing for beryllium material composition a range of possible U impurity content between 0 and 100 ppmwt. First Wall neutron wall load ranging from 0.5 to 2.2MW/m2and neutron fluence from 0.5 to 10.5MWyear/m2are considered (for ITER and DEMO-type reactor, respectively) to estimate the Pu production. In all those analyses the irradiation scenarios considered are based on a deuterium-tritium plasma. The evaluation have been performed using the EASY-2007 activation code package, with the EAF2007 activation library. An estimate of the Pu production at the end of the ITER fusion machine preliminary operation with deuterium-deuterium plasma is also presented. A preliminary analysis of the regulatory constraints on the maximum Pu production and indications of possible way for its minimisation is presented and discussed in the paper. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The study to date has mainly involved establishing the overall nature of the Anthropocene as a potential chronostratigraphic/geochronologic unit, and exploring the stratigraphic proxies, including several that are novel in geology, that might be applied to its characterization and definition. A preliminary summary of evidence and interim recommendations was presented by the Working Group at the 35th International Geological Congress in Cape Town, South Africa, in August 2016, together with results of voting by members of the AWG indicating the current balance of opinion on major questions surrounding the Anthropocene. The majority opinion within the AWG holds the Anthropocene to be stratigraphically real, and recommends formalization at epoch/series rank based on a mid-20th century boundary. Work is proceeding towards a formal proposal based upon selection of an appropriate Global boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP), as well as auxiliary stratotypes. Among the array of proxies that might be used as a primary marker, anthropogenic radionuclides associated with nuclear arms testing are the most promising; potential secondary markers include plastic, carbon isotope patterns and industrial fly ash. All these proxies have excellent global or near-global correlation potential in a wide variety of sedimentary bodies, both marine and non-marine.},

abstract = {Late Pleistocene extinctions are of interest to paleontological and anthropological research. In North America and Australia, human occupation occurred during a short period of time and overexploitation may have led to the extinction of mammalian megafauna. In northern Eurasia megafaunal extinctions are believed to have occurred over a relatively longer period of time, perhaps as a result of changing environmental conditions, but the picture is much less clear. To consider megafaunal extinction in Eurasia, we compare differences in the geographical distribution and commonness of extinct and extant species between paleontological and archaeological localities from the late middle Pleistocene to Holocene. Purely paleontological localities, as well as most extinct species, were distributed north of archaeological sites and of the extant species, suggesting that apart from possible differences in adaptations between humans and other species, humans could also have a detrimental effect on large mammal distribution. However, evidence for human overexploitation applies only to the extinct steppe bison Bison priscus. Other human-preferred species survive into the Holocene, including Rangifer tarandus, Equus ferus, Capreolus capreolus, Cervus elaphus, Equus hemionus, Saiga tatarica, and Sus scrofa. Mammuthus primigenius and Megaloceros giganteus were rare in archaeological sites. Carnivores appear little influenced by human presence, although they become rarer in Holocene archaeological sites. Overall, the data are consistent with the conclusion that humans acted as efficient hunters selecting for the most abundant species. Our study supports the idea that the late Pleistocene extinctions were environmentally driven by climatic changes that triggered habitat fragmentation, species range reduction, and population decrease, after which human interference either by direct hunting or via indirect activities probably became critical. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Understanding species extinction is a major concern today, and past extinctions provide valuable lessons. Numerous mammal species became extinct in the Arctic at the end of the ice age, but it is unclear why. By comparing numbers of dated bones with climate records, we find that megafaunal species, like mammoth, horse, and bison, experienced boom and bust cycles during the ice age as they tracked rapid climate changes. For these species to persist, long-distance dispersal was necessary. Their extinction on the North Slope occurred as the ice age ended, because rising sea level severed dispersal routes and spreading peat simultaneously degraded range quality. This finding suggests that arctic mammals can be resilient to environmental changes but only if their habitats remain widely interconnected.Understanding the population dynamics of megafauna that inhabited the mammoth steppe provides insights into the causes of extinctions during both the terminal Pleistocene and today. Our study area is Alaska{\{}$\backslash$textquoteright{\}}s North Slope, a place where humans were rare when these extinctions occurred. After developing a statistical approach to remove the age artifacts caused by radiocarbon calibration from a large series of dated megafaunal bones, we compare the temporal patterns of bone abundance with climate records. Megafaunal abundance tracked ice age climate, peaking during transitions from cold to warm periods. These results suggest that a defining characteristic of the mammoth steppe was its temporal instability and imply that regional extinctions followed by population reestablishment from distant refugia were characteristic features of ice-age biogeography at high latitudes. It follows that long-distance dispersal was crucial for the long-term persistence of megafaunal species living in the Arctic. Such dispersal was only possible when their rapidly shifting range lands were geographically interconnected. The end of the last ice age was fatally unique because the geographic ranges of arctic megafauna became permanently fragmented after stable, interglacial climate engendered the spread of peatlands at the same time that rising sea level severed former dispersal routes.},

Digital Comprehensive Summaries of Uppsala Dissertations from the Faculty of Science and Technology 1315. 85 pp. Uppsala: Acta Universitatis Upsaliensis. ISBN 978-91-554-9407-0. For the successful deployment of advanced nuclear systems and optimization of current reactor designs, high quality nuclear data are required. Before nuclear data can be used in applications they must first be evaluated, tested and validated against a set of integral experiments, and then converted into formats usable for applications. The evaluation process in the past was usually done by using differential experimental data which was then complemented with nuclear model calculations. This trend is fast changing due to the increase in computational power and tremendous improvements in nuclear reaction models over the last decade. Since these models have uncertain inputs, they are normally calibrated using experimental data. However, these experiments are themselves not exact. Therefore, the calculated quantities of model codes such as cross sections and angular distributions contain uncertainties. Since nuclear data are used in reactor transport codes as input for simulations, the output of transport codes contain uncertainties due to these data as well. Quantifying these uncertainties is important for setting safety margins; for providing confidence in the interpretation of results; and for deciding where additional efforts are needed to reduce these uncertainties. Also, regulatory bodies are now moving away from conservative evaluations to best estimate calculations that are accompanied by uncertainty evaluations. In this work, the Total Monte Carlo (TMC) method was applied to study the impact of nuclear data uncertainties from basic physics to macroscopic reactor parameters for the European Lead Cooled Training Reactor (ELECTRA). As part of the work, nuclear data uncertainties of actinides in the fuel, lead isotopes within the coolant, and some structural materials have been investigated. In the case of the lead coolant it was observed that the uncertainty in the k eff and the coolant void worth (except in the case of},

While maintenance and bug fixes will continue for MCNP5 1.60 and MCNPX 2.7.0 for upcoming years, new code development capabilities only will be developed and released in MCNP6. In fact, the initial release of MCNP6 contains 16 new features not previously found in either code. These new features include the abilities to import unstructured mesh geometries from the finite element code Abaqus, to transport photons down to 1.0 eV, to transport electrons down to 10.0 eV, to model complete atomic relaxation emissions, and to generate or read mesh geometries for use with the LANL discrete ordinates code Partisn. The first release of MCNP6, MCNP6 Beta 2, is now available through the Radiation Safety Information Computational Center, and the first production release is expected in calendar year 2012.

It begins with the generation of pointwise libraries, including reaction and resonance reconstruction, Doppler broadening, radiation heating and damage, thermal scattering data, unresolved resonance data, and gas production. It then reviews the production of libraries for the continuous-energy Monte Carlo code MCNP, multigroup neutron, photon, and particle cross sections and matrices, and photon interaction data. The generation of uncertainty information for ENDF data is discussed, including new capabilities for calculating covariances of resonance data, angular distributions, energy distributions, and radioactive nuclide production. NJOY's ability to prepare thermal scattering data evaluations for bound moderators (which was used during the preparation of the ENDF/B-VII library) is described. The strong plotting capabilities of NJOY are summarized. Many examples of black{\&}white and color Postscript plots are included throughout the paper.

A D-T fusion neutron (14.1 MeV) is used as a neutron source. Fissile zone is cooled: (a) with light water for the moderated blanket and (b) with pressurized helium gas for the fast blanket. The neutronic parameters have been evaluated with and without a resonance treatment for the same blanket compositions for the sake of a consistent comparison. The study has shown that neutron reactions above a threshold energy in fast neutron groups are less sensitive to resonance treatment, such as 7Li(n,??n') T and 232Th(n,f). Neutron energy-group structures in the neutron libraries and description ef fusion neutron source spectrum mainly affect these reactions. On the other hand, neutron reactions in the resonance and thermal energy groups are sensitive to resonance treatment, such as 6Li(n,??) T and 232Th(n,??), depending on the resonance structures. In the fast blanket calculations, resonance-based errors are lower and neutron source based errors are higher than in the moderated blanket. Further-more, a correct description of the fusion neutron source spectrum over several neutron energy groups is essential to calculate fission reaction rates, fission heating density, fosile and fissile breeding rates and neutron leakage accurately. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Energy group structure has a significant effect on the results of multigroup transport calculations. It is known that UO2 –PuO2 (MOX) is a recently developed fuel which consumes recycled plutonium. For such fuel which contains various resonant nuclides, the selection of energy group structure is more crucial comparing to the UO2 fuels. In this paper, in order to improve the accuracy of the integral results in MOX thermal lattices calculated by WIMSD-5B code, a swarm intelligence method is employed to optimize the energy group structure of WIMS library. In this process, the NJOY code system is used to generate the 69 group cross sections of WIMS code for the specified energy structure. In addition, the multiplication factor and spectral indices are compared against the results of continuous energy MCNP-4C code for evaluating the energy group structure. Calculations performed in four different types of H2 O moderated UO2 –PuO2 (MOX) lattices show that the optimized energy structure obtains more accurate results in comparison with the WIMS original structure.},

abstract = {Fispact-II is a code system and library database for modelling activation-transmutation processes, depletion-burn-up, time dependent inventory and radiation damage source terms caused by nuclear reactions and decays. The Fispact-II code, written in object-style Fortran, follows the evolution of material irradiated by neutrons, alphas, gammas, protons, or deuterons, and provides a wide range of derived radiological output quantities to satisfy most needs for nuclear applications. It can be used with any ENDF-compliant group library data for nuclear reactions, particle-induced and spontaneous fission yields, and radioactive decay (including but not limited to TENDL-2015, ENDF/B-VII.1, JEFF-3.2, JENDL-4.0u, CENDL-3.1 processed into fine-group-structure files, GEFY-5.2 and UKDD-16), as well as resolved and unresolved resonance range probability tables for self-shielding corrections and updated radiological hazard indices. The code has many novel features including: extension of the energy range up to 1 GeV; additional neutron physics including self-shielding effects, temperature dependence, thin and thick target yields; pathway analysis; and sensitivity and uncertainty quantification and propagation using full covariance data. The latest ENDF libraries such as TENDL encompass thousands of target isotopes. Nuclear data libraries for Fispact-II are prepared from these using processing codes PREPRO, NJOY and CALENDF. These data include resonance parameters, cross sections with covariances, probability tables in the resonance ranges, PKA spectra, kerma, dpa, gas and radionuclide production and energy-dependent fission yields, supplemented with all 27 decay types. All such data for the five most important incident particles are provided in evaluated data tables. The Fispact-II simulation software is described in detail in this paper, together with the nuclear data libraries. The Fispact-II system also includes several utility programs for code-use optimisation, visualisation and production of secondary radiological quantities. Included in the paper are summaries of results from the suite of verification and validation reports available with the code.},

abstract = {Multi-group theory is widely applied for the energy domain discretization when solving the Linear Boltzmann Equation. To reduce the computational cost, fine group cross libraries are often down-sampled into broad group cross section libraries. Cross section data collapsing generally involves two steps: Firstly, the broad group structure has to be determined; secondly, a weighting scheme is used to evaluate the broad cross section library based on the fine group cross section data and the broad group structure. A common scheme is to average the fine group cross section weighted by the fine group flux. Cross section collapsing techniques have been intensively researched. However, most studies use a pre-determined group structure, open based on experience, to divide the neutron energy spectrum into thermal, epi-thermal, fast, etc. energy range. In this paper, a swarm intelligence algorithm, particle swarm optimization (PSO), is applied to optimize the broad group structure. A graph representation of the broad group structure determination problem is introduced. And the swarm intelligence algorithm is used to solve the graph model. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated using a fuel-pin model. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Accurately quantifying the transmutation rate of tungsten (W) under neutron irradiation is a necessary requirement in the assessment of its performance as an armour material in a fusion power plant. The usual approach of calculating average responses, assuming large, homogenised material volumes, is insufficient to capture the full complexity of the transmutation picture in the context of a realistic fusion power plant design, particularly for rhenium (Re) production from W. Combined neutron transport and inventory simulations for representative {\{}$\backslash$it spatially heterogeneous{\}} models of a fusion power plant show that the production rate of Re is strongly influenced by the local spatial environment. Localised variation in neutron moderation (slowing down) due to structural steel and coolant, particularly water, can dramatically increase Re production because of the huge cross sections of giant resolved resonances in the neutron-capture reaction of $\backslash$({\^{}}{\{}186{\}}$\backslash$)W at low neutron energies. Calculations using cross section data corrected for temperature (Doppler) effects suggest that temperature may have a relatively lesser influence on transmutation rates.},

abstract = {The results are presented of a sensitivity and uncertainty analysis of a NET iron/water inboard shielding blanket using energy self-shielded cross sections. Coupled (n, ??) transport calculations were performed in an S8P3 approximation using cross sections derived from the European Fusion File in the 121-group GAM-II structure. Energy self-shielding was taken into account using the Bondarenko method. The results of this analysis are compared with a similar analysis in which infinite dilute cross sections were used. It is shown that the effect of energy self-shielding on the neutron flux in the coils of the NET design is considerable, whereas the ??-flux is hardly influenced at all. This causes the nuclear heating in the inboard coils to be increased by 13{\%}. The relative uncertainty in the nuclear heating due to uncertainties in the total cross sections of Fe, Cr and Ni decreases by 8{\%} when self-shielding is taken into account. In addition, the effects of uncertainties in the energy and angular distributions of the scattered neutrons (SED and SAD respectively) were studied. SED uncertainties appear to have only a minor effect. SAD uncertainties, however, are quite important for elastic scattering. It is therefore concluded that more attention should be paid to these SAD uncertainties. ?? 1991.},

Neutron flux spectra and tritium production rates have been calculated using MCNP with a modified version of the ITER Alite torus sector model with integrated TBMs. Sensitivities of such parameters to nuclear cross sections of isotopes contained in the TBM as well as in the ITER device have been calculated using the Monte Carlo code MCSEN. Uncertainties could be obtained by using existing covariance data of the important nuclear cross section files, mainly from ENDF/B-VI, SCALE6.0, but also from recent JEFF/EFF evaluations. Like in the HCLL mock-up experiment two positions at front and back of the TBM have been selected. In both cases the calculated uncertainties of the responses (tritium production rate, neutron flux) are in the range of 2-4{\%}. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Recently, we have presented an exact method (now called “Total Monte Carlo”) to propagate uncertainties of fundamental nuclear physics experiments, models and parameters to large and complicated nuclear systems. We now show that such exact uncertainty calculations are directly relevant to the optimal and safe design of fusion systems by applying this methodology to a series of fusion shielding benchmarks, namely those connected to the Oktavian, FNS and LLNL experiments. Uncertainties on neutron and gamma leakage fluxes for shielding benchmarks are obtained. Un- certainties for cross sections, angular distributions, single- and double-differential emission spectra, and gamma-ray production cross sections are considered.},

abstract = {This paper presents a general overview of nuclear data evaluation and its applications as developed at NRG, Petten. Based on concepts such as robustness, reproducibility and automation, modern calculation tools are exploited to produce original nuclear data libraries that meet the current demands on quality and completeness. This requires a system which comprises differential measurements, theory development, nuclear model codes, resonance analysis, evaluation, ENDF formatting, data processing and integral validation in one integrated approach. Software, built around the TALYS code, will be presented in which all these essential nuclear data components are seamlessly integrated. Besides the quality of the basic data and its extensive format testing, a second goal lies in the diversity of processing for different type of users. The implications of this scheme are unprecedented. The most important are:. 1. Complete ENDF-6 nuclear data files, in the form of the TENDL library, including covariance matrices, for many isotopes, particles, energies, reaction channels and derived quantities. All isotopic data files are mutually consistent and are supposed to rival those of the major world libraries.2. More exact uncertainty propagation from basic nuclear physics to applied (reactor) calculations based on a Monte Carlo approach: "Total" Monte Carlo (TMC), using random nuclear data libraries.3. Automatic optimization in the form of systematic feedback from integral measurements back to the basic data. This method of work also opens a new way of approaching the analysis of nuclear applications, with consequences in both applied nuclear physics and safety of nuclear installations, and several examples are given here. This applied experience and feedback is integrated in a final step to improve the quality of the nuclear data, to change the users vision and finally to orchestrate their integration into simulation codes. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

@phdthesis{Rising2012,
abstract = {The use of several uncertainty quantification and propagation methodologies is investigated in the context of the prompt fission neutron spectrum (PFNS) uncer- tainties and its impact on critical reactor assemblies. First, the first-order, linear Kalman filter is used as a nuclear data evaluation and uncertainty quantification tool combining available PFNS experimental data and a modified version of the Los Alamos (LA) model. The experimental covariance matrices, not generally given in the EXFOR database, are computed using the GMA methodology used by the IAEA to establish more appropriate correlations within each experiment. Then, using sys- tematics relating the LA model parameters across a suite of isotopes, the PFNS for both the uranium and plutonium actinides are evaluated leading to a new evaluation including cross-isotope correlations. Next, an alternative evaluation approach, the unified Monte Carlo (UMC) method, is studied for the evaluation of the PFNS for the n(0.5 MeV)239Pu fission reaction and compared to the Kalman filter. The UMC approach to nuclear data evaluation is implemented in a variety of ways to test con- vergence toward the Kalman filter results and to determine the nonlinearities present in the LA model. Ultimately, the UMC approach is shown to be comparable to the Kalman filter for a realistic data evaluation of the PFNS and is capable of captur- ing the nonlinearities present in the LA model. Next, the impact that the PFNS uncertainties have on important critical assemblies is investigated. Using the PFNS covariance matrices in the ENDF/B-VII.1 nuclear data library, the uncertainties of the effective multiplication factor, leakage, and spectral indices of the Lady Godiva and Jezebel critical assemblies are quantified. Using principal component analysis on the PFNS covariance matrices results in needing only 2–3 principal components to re- tain the PFNS uncertainties. Then, using the polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) on the uncertain output quantities, the stochastic collocation method (SCM) is used to compute the PCE coefficients. Compared to the “brute force” Monte Carlo forward propagation method, the PCE-SCM approach is shown to be capable of obtaining the same amount of output quantity uncertainty information with orders of magnitude computational savings. Finally, the uncertainties quantified in the correlated model parameters for the suite of uranium and plutonium actinides are propagated through the Big Ten and Flattop assemblies. In the case of the keff uncertainties in the Big Ten assembly, the uncorrelated PFNS uncertainties leads to 17.5{\%} smaller predicted uncertainties compared with the correlated PFNS uncertainties, suggesting the pres- ence of these cross-isotope correlations are important for this application. Last, the unified Monte Carlo + total Monte Carlo (UMC+TMC) method is implemented to propagate uncertainties from the prior LA model parameters through the Flattop critical assemblies. Due to the fact that cross-experiment correlations are neglected in all of the present evaluation work, the UMC+TMC suffers by predicting smaller uncertainties in the integral quantities by an order of magnitude or more compared to direct sampling from the posterior LA model parameters.},

abstract = {The modeling of the component material composition during and after the fusion energy power plant's operational lifetime is required for radiation protection, fuel cycle, radioactive waste disposal and reactor performance. The computational load and accuracy of the models are dependant on the method of reaction rate calculation. The generation of reaction rates within Monte-Carlo (MC) transport codes can be accomplished via (1) the standard point-wise estimator approach of tallying the pointwise flux and pointwise partial cross sections and/or (2) the multigroup approach which convolves a pointwise neutron flux with pre-defined binned partial cross-sections. Even fine multigroup sampling is more efficient when compared to pointwise Monte-Carlo sampling due to the removal of the cross-section interpolation from the calculation. This paper describes the four stage optimization procedure used to find an energy binning format which enables an accurate enough and computationally efficient calculation of any reaction rate when applied to MC modeling of IFE/MFE devices. This optimum format, named FOMG (Fusion Optimised Multi-Group), was evaluated using a SINBAD (Shielding Integral Benchmark Archive Database) benchmark. Despite the number of multi-group bins exceeding the number of data elements for a significant number of the ENDF files the MCNP simulation took more than one hundred times longer to calculate reaction rates using the pointwise approach when compared to the multi-group method with FOMG structure.},

Much progress has been achieved in this area over the past decade, largely as result of the effort spent by the national fusion technology programmes in the EU, Japan, the RF and the US and supported by the international thermonuclear experimental reactor (ITER) project. In conjunction with the conduction of various integral benchmark experiments, this has led to the development of a well-qualified nuclear database for fusion applications, the international fusion evaluated nuclear data library (FENDL), and the assessment of safety margins derived for reactor design relevant responses. Further development work is required to enable direct uncertainty calculations for fusion reactor applications. This requires a Monte Carlo code capable for full sensitivity and uncertainty calculations along with high-quality, co-variance data as well as suitable integral benchmark experiments for qualification and validation purposes. This proceeding will allow specifying, by Monte Carlo calculations, the design relevant responses with their associated uncertainties and thus directly providing the related design safety margins.},

The primary objective of the experiment was to validate the MCNP calculations (C) of nuclear heating measured (E) in the region corresponding to the ITER Toroidal Field (TF) coil. An accuracy on C/E ratio of 10{\%} was required. The neutronics and shielding properties of the mock-up were also studied throughout the measurement of selected activation reaction rates up to about 1 m depth. Due to the very low activity induced in the foils, the measurements in the deepest experimental positions were performed at the underground low background facility of the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso, using ultra-low background high purity germanium (HPGe) detectors.

This includes the accumulative DPA and helium production in the UPP structure and the vacuum vessel, fast neutron fluence reaching the neighboring TF and PF magnets, and the accumulative local heating in their coil casings. In the present work, we assess these performance characteristics in three generic upper port plug (GUPP) designs of the in-plug shield and labyrinths that span possible configurations ranging from a conservative to worst case. The cases considered are: (1) Case A: "Visible-IR Camera diagnostic" with an intact port-attached blanket shield module (BSM), and (2) Case B: vis/IR system where the port-based BSM is replaced by overlapping adjacent vessel-attached BSM and (3) Case C: a "Large Aperture diagnostic" that is loosely resembles ECH style shielding plugs and aperture.

The possible use of lithium-ion batteries on a large scale, particularly in the automobile industry, could, however, use up all the known terrestrial reserves and resources of lithium in the next few decades. Little attention has been paid so far to the financial, energetic, and above all, environmental aspects of lithium extraction from seawater.

@article{Batistoni2007,
abstract = {A neutronics experiment has been performed in the frame of European Fusion Technology Program on a mock-up of the EU Test Blanket Module (TBM), HCPB concept, with the objective to validate the capability of nuclear data to predict nuclear responses, such as the tritium production rate (TPR), with qualified uncertainties. In the experiment, the TPR has been measured using Li2CO3 pellets located at various depths at two symmetrical positions at each depth, one in the upper and one in the lower breeder cassette. Three independent measurements were performed by ENEA, TUD/VKTA and JAEA. The neutron flux in the beryllium layer was measured as well using activation foils. The measured tritium production in the TBM (E) was compared with the same quantity (C) calculated by the MCNP-4C code using a very detailed model of the experimental set up. A sensitivity and uncertainty analysis has also been performed to evaluate the calculation uncertainty due to the uncertainty on neutron cross sections. The results of such analysis, carried out using both Monte Carlo and deterministic codes, shows that the uncertainty due to cross sections amounts to 4-5{\%} (2$\sigma$). C/E ratios were obtained with a total uncertainty on the C/E comparison of 9-10{\%} (2$\sigma$). The C/E comparison shows that the calculation of the tritium production is underestimated by about 10{\%} in average and is within the combined 2$\sigma$ uncertainty margin of the measurements and the calculations. The obtained results indicate that design calculations of the tritium breeding ratio provide conservative results for the fusion reactor employing a HCPB type breeder blanket. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The Korea Helium Cooled Solid Breeder Test Blanket Module (Korea HCSB TBM) uses a pebble material in the tritium breeder, neutron multiplier and neutron reflector. A simplified multi-layer model homogenized in the pebble regions is used in the neutronics analysis to increase the efficiency of modeling calculations. Modeling results show that the homogenized model underestimated the TBR by approximately 2{\%} compared to more traditional model. Differences in total mass and packing fractions are the major factors affecting this underestimate. Future uses of the homogenized model should take these factors into account.},

@article{Ihli2008,
abstract = {The dominating fraction of the power generated by fusion in the reactor is captured by neutron moderation in the blanket surrounding the plasma. From this, the efficiency of the fusion plant is predominated by the technologies applied to make electricity or hydrogen from the neutrons. The main blanket concepts addressed in this paper are advanced ceramic breeder concepts, dual coolant blankets as well as self-cooled liquid metal and Flibe blankets. Two important questions that are addressed are: (i) Can we draw a bottom line conclusion on the most promising concept(s)? (ii) What are the common issues to be resolved independently from individual design and layout proposals to define a feasible route towards advanced fusion reactors? For ceramic breeder concepts, a key issue in the long term could be the limitation of beryllium as the considered multiplier in terms of world sources and achievable temperature levels. For liquid metal blankets, attractive long-term visions have been developed but major technological challenges also exist for the in-vessel blanket technology and the corresponding sub-systems. The paper proposes a strategic conclusion derived from the review of blanket designs for advanced fusion reactors. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},
