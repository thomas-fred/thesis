abstract = {Based on the well-established generalized perturbation theory (GPT), an equivalent method (EGPT) is proposed. An advantage of this new formulation is that in many circumstances of interest the difficulties in calculating the functions entering into the perturbation expressions can be simplified, in particular, allowing us to reduce the equations governing them from an inhomogeneous to a homogeneous form. After a general derivation of the method, its specialization to a number of different problems is made. Numerical tests for a variety of cases are finally illustrated, confirming the validity of the EGPT methodology. {\textcopyright} 1986.},

abstract = {The tritium required for ITER will be supplied from the CANDU production in Ontario, but while Ontario may be able to supply 8 kg for a DEMO fusion reactor in the mid-2050s, it will not be able to provide 10 kg at any realistic starting time. The tritium required to start DEMO will depend on advances in plasma fuelling efficiency, burnup fraction, and tritium processing technology. It is in theory possible to start up a fusion reactor with little or no tritium, but at an estimated cost of {\$}2 billion per kilogram of tritium saved, it is not economically sensible. Some heavy water reactor tritium production scenarios with varying degrees of optimism are presented, with the assumption that only Canada, the Republic of Korea, and Romania make tritium available to the fusion community. Results for the tritium available for DEMO in 2055 range from zero to 30 kg. CANDU and similar heavy water reactors could in theory generate additional tritium in a number of ways: (a) adjuster rods containing lithium could be used, giving 0.13 kg per year per reactor; (b) a fuel bundle with a burnable absorber has been designed for CANDU reactors, which might be adapted for tritium production; (c) tritium production could be increased by 0.05 kg per year per reactor by doping the moderator with lithium-6. If a fusion reactor is started up around 2055, governments in Canada, Argentina, China, India, South Korea and Romania will have the opportunity in the years leading up to that to take appropriate steps: (a) build, refurbish or upgrade tritium extraction facilities; (b) extend the lives of heavy water reactors, or build new ones; (c) reduce tritium sales; (d) boost tritium production in the remaining heavy water reactors. All of the alternative production methods considered have serious economic and regulatory drawbacks, and the risk of diversion of tritium or lithium-6 would also be a major concern. There are likely to be serious problems with supplying tritium for future fusion reactors.},

abstract = {A significant functional upgrade is planned for the Mega Ampere Spherical Tokamak (MAST) device, located at Culham in the UK, including the implementation of a notably greater neutral beam injection power. This upgrade will cause the emission of a substantially increased intensity of neutron radiation for a substantially increased amount of time upon operation of the device. Existing shielding and activation precautions are shown to prove insufficient in some regards, and recommendations for improvements are made, including the following areas: shielding doors to MAST shielded facility enclosure (known as "the blockhouse"); north access tunnel; blockhouse roof; west cabling duct. In addition, some specific neutronic dose rate questions are addressed and answered; those discussed here relate to shielding penetrations and dose rate reflected from the air above the device ("skyshine"). It is shown that the alterations to shielding and area access reduce the dose rate in unrestricted areas from greater than 100 $\mu$Sv/h to less than 2 $\mu$Sv/h averaged over the working day. The tools used for this analysis are the MCNP (Monte Carlo N-particle) code, used to calculate the three-dimensional spatial distribution of neutron and photon dose rates in and around the device and its shields, and the nuclear inventory code FISPACT, run under the umbrella code MCR2S, used to calculate the time-dependent shutdown dose rate in the region of the device at several decay times. {\textcopyright} 2014 EURATOM/CCFE Fusion Association.},

While excellent agreement exists between the two Monte Carlo results, the 187 rate is overestimated by about a factor of 4 when a homogenised model is used with multi-group sampling. To correctly predict reaction rates in tungsten, 3-D continuous energy Monte Carlo calculations with layered heteroge- neous modelling should be used.

abstract = {Understanding the behavior of a plasma chamber component in the fusion environment requires a simulation technique that is capable of integrating multi-disciplinary computational codes while appropriately treating geometric heterogeneity and complexity. Such a tool should be able to interpret phenomena from mutually dependent scientific disciplines and predict performance with sufficient accuracy and consistency. Integrated multi-physics simulation predictive capability (ISPC) relies upon advanced numerical simulation techniques and is being applied to ITER first wall/shield and Test Blanket Module (TBM) designs. In this paper, progress in ISPC development is described through the presentation of a number of integrated simulations. The simulations cover key physical phenomena encountered in a fusion plasma chamber system, including tritium permeation, fluid dynamics, and structure mechanics. Interface engines were developed in order to pass field data, such as surface deformation or nuclear heating rate, from the structural analysis to the thermo-fluid MHD analysis code for magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) velocity profile assessments, or from the neutronics analysis to the thermo-fluid analysis for temperature calculations, respectively. Near-term effort toward further ISPC development is discussed. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.The measured D-D neutron rate of neutral beam heated JET baseline and hybrid H-modes in deuterium is found to be between approximately 50{\%} and 100{\%} of the neutron rate expected from the TRANSP code, depending on the plasma parameters. A number of candidate explanations for the shortfall, such as fuel dilution, errors in beam penetration and effectively available beam power have been excluded. As the neutron rate in JET is dominated by beam-plasma interactions, the 'neutron deficit' may be caused by a yet unidentified form of fast particle redistribution. Modelling, which assumes fast particle transport to be responsible for the deficit, indicates that such redistribution would have to happen at time scales faster than both the slowing down time and the energy confinement time. Sawteeth and edge localised modes are found to make no significant contribution to the deficit. There is also no obvious correlation with magnetohydrodynamic activity measured using magnetic probes at the tokamak vessel walls. Modelling of fast particle orbits in the 3D fields of neoclassical tearing modes shows that realistically sized islands can only contribute a few percent to the deficit. In view of these results it appears unlikely that the neutron deficit results from a single physical process in the plasma.},

abstract = {A future fusion reactor will use deuterium and tritium as fuel. The former is found in abundance in seawater, while the latter is not available naturally due to its short lifetime. Present developments in the context of fusion propose generating tritium in a blanket based on the reaction n + 6Li ??? T + He. This paper will review the issue of the reserves and resources of lithium as the fuel for fusion energy. We describe the available reserves and resources and their chemical forms. We analyze the present production and consumption for industrial uses, completing this overview by referring to a life cycle analysis in the case of the lithium production from brine. The lithium extraction from seawater is also described. Taking into account the previous data and the requirements estimated for fusion plants, we propose scenarios for future lithium consumption, and we conclude on the lithium availability over the next centuries dealing with the different hypothesis considered. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Digital Comprehensive Summaries of Uppsala Dissertations from the Faculty of Science and Technology 1315. 85 pp. Uppsala: Acta Universitatis Upsaliensis. ISBN 978-91-554-9407-0. For the successful deployment of advanced nuclear systems and optimization of current reactor designs, high quality nuclear data are required. Before nuclear data can be used in applications they must first be evaluated, tested and validated against a set of integral experiments, and then converted into formats usable for applications. The evaluation process in the past was usually done by using differential experimental data which was then complemented with nuclear model calculations. This trend is fast changing due to the increase in computational power and tremendous improvements in nuclear reaction models over the last decade. Since these models have uncertain inputs, they are normally calibrated using experimental data. However, these experiments are themselves not exact. Therefore, the calculated quantities of model codes such as cross sections and angular distributions contain uncertainties. Since nuclear data are used in reactor transport codes as input for simulations, the output of transport codes contain uncertainties due to these data as well. Quantifying these uncertainties is important for setting safety margins; for providing confidence in the interpretation of results; and for deciding where additional efforts are needed to reduce these uncertainties. Also, regulatory bodies are now moving away from conservative evaluations to best estimate calculations that are accompanied by uncertainty evaluations. In this work, the Total Monte Carlo (TMC) method was applied to study the impact of nuclear data uncertainties from basic physics to macroscopic reactor parameters for the European Lead Cooled Training Reactor (ELECTRA). As part of the work, nuclear data uncertainties of actinides in the fuel, lead isotopes within the coolant, and some structural materials have been investigated. In the case of the lead coolant it was observed that the uncertainty in the k eff and the coolant void worth (except in the case of},

These analyses, Koomey and Hultman (2007); Grubler (2010), and Escobar-Rangel and L{\'{e}}v{\^{e}}que (2015), study only 26{\%} of reactors built globally between 1960 and 2010, providing an incomplete picture of the economic evolution of nuclear power construction. This study curates historical reactor-specific overnight construction cost (OCC) data that broaden the scope of study substantially, covering the full cost history for 349 reactors in the US, France, Canada, West Germany, Japan, India, and South Korea, encompassing 58{\%} of all reactors built globally. We find that trends in costs have varied significantly in magnitude and in structure by era, country, and experience. In contrast to the rapid cost escalation that characterized nuclear construction in the United States, we find evidence of much milder cost escalation in many countries, including absolute cost declines in some countries and specific eras. Our new findings suggest that there is no inherent cost escalation trend associated with nuclear technology.},

abstract = {For a tokamak fusion DEMO reactor with the fusion output of 2.95 GW, neutronic and thermal design of blanket is under way to find a feasible blanket concept. For the continuity with the Japanese ITER-TBM options, this study considered water-cooled blanket with solid breeding materials of Li ceramics (Li4SiO4, Li2TiO3 and Li 2ZrO3) and Be multipliers (Be and Be12Ti). Based on a neutronics-heat coupled analysis, the tritium breeding ratio was evaluated so as to satisfy constraints of the operating temperature of ???900??C for Li ceramics and Be12Ti, and ???600??C for Be. Cooling water condition was assumed to be 23MPa and 290-360??C. The result indicates that surplus tritium production in lower neutron wall load (P n) blanket compensates a shortfall in higher Pn blanket and thus the overall tritium production can marginally satisfy fuel self-sufficiency. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This paper provides a description of the system's capabilities, summary descriptions of the methods used, and information on how to use the code to process the modern evaluated nuclear data files from ENDF/B-VII. It begins with the generation of pointwise libraries, including reaction and resonance reconstruction, Doppler broadening, radiation heating and damage, thermal scattering data, unresolved resonance data, and gas production. It then reviews the production of libraries for the continuous-energy Monte Carlo code MCNP, multigroup neutron, photon, and particle cross sections and matrices, and photon interaction data. The generation of uncertainty information for ENDF data is discussed, including new capabilities for calculating covariances of resonance data, angular distributions, energy distributions, and radioactive nuclide production. NJOY's ability to prepare thermal scattering data evaluations for bound moderators (which was used during the preparation of the ENDF/B-VII library) is described. The strong plotting capabilities of NJOY are summarized. Many examples of black{\&}white and color Postscript plots are included throughout the paper. The capabilities of NJOY to output multigroup data in several different formats to suit various applications is reviewed. Finally, a section is included that summarizes the history of the development of the NJOY system over the last 37 years. ?? 2010.},

The direct cost of electricity of a fusion power plant and its key dependencies on the physics and technology assumptions, are calculated, as are the materials requirements. The other important aspect of costs, the external costs which can arise from effects such as pollution, accidents and waste are also given. Fusion is found to offer the prospect of a new energy source with acceptable direct costs and very low external costs.

The sub-module will have its own FW and structural container box that houses the breeder and beryllium pebble bed units, arranged in an edge-on-configuration. Low activation ferritic steel (F82H) is used as the structure and helium is used as a coolant. The breeder beds are made of Li2TiO3 pebbles in which lithium has been enriched up to 75{\%} in Li-6. Pulsed operation mode is assumed. During operation in the D-T phase, the total heating rate in the TBM is ???263 kW. The total amount of tritium generated in the breeder and the beryllium multiplier is ???9 g and 0.07 g, respectively, after reaching the 0.3 MWa/m2 fluence limit. At shutdown, the total radioactivity and decay heat levels are ???0.89 MCi and ???0.002 MW, respectively. These values drop sharply after 1 min to ???0.098 MCi and ???0.0006 MW. The contribution from the F82H structure is the dominant one up to ???10 years following shutdown. After ???10 years, the contribution to the total activation and decay heat from the breeder material is the dominant one due to the generated tritium. The WDR of various components are far below unity and thus are well within ITER regulatory guidelines. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.},

It is known that UO2 –PuO2 (MOX) is a recently developed fuel which consumes recycled plutonium. For such fuel which contains various resonant nuclides, the selection of energy group structure is more crucial comparing to the UO2 fuels. In this paper, in order to improve the accuracy of the integral results in MOX thermal lattices calculated by WIMSD-5B code, a swarm intelligence method is employed to optimize the energy group structure of WIMS library. In this process, the NJOY code system is used to generate the 69 group cross sections of WIMS code for the specified energy structure. In addition, the multiplication factor and spectral indices are compared against the results of continuous energy MCNP-4C code for evaluating the energy group structure. Calculations performed in four different types of H2 O moderated UO2 –PuO2 (MOX) lattices show that the optimized energy structure obtains more accurate results in comparison with the WIMS original structure.},

abstract = {MCNP6 is simply and accurately described as the merger of MCNP5 and MCNPX capabilities, but it is much more than the sum of those two computer codes. MCNP6 is the result of five years of effort by the MCNP5 and MCNPX code development teams. These groups of people, residing in Los Alamos National Laboratory's (LANL) X Computational Physics Division, Monte Carlo Codes Group (XCP-3), and Decision Applications Division, Radiation Transport and Applications Team (D-5), respectively, have combined their code development efforts to produce the next evolution of MCNP. While maintenance and bug fixes will continue for MCNP5 1.60 and MCNPX 2.7.0 for upcoming years, new code development capabilities only will be developed and released in MCNP6. In fact, the initial release of MCNP6 contains 16 new features not previously found in either code. These new features include the abilities to import unstructured mesh geometries from the finite element code Abaqus, to transport photons down to 1.0 eV, to transport electrons down to 10.0 eV, to model complete atomic relaxation emissions, and to generate or read mesh geometries for use with the LANL discrete ordinates code Partisn. The first release of MCNP6, MCNP6 Beta 2, is now available through the Radiation Safety Information Computational Center, and the first production release is expected in calendar year 2012. High confidence in the MCNP6 code is based on its performance with the verification and validation test suites, comparisons to its predecessor codes, the regression test suite, its code development process, and the underlying high-quality nuclear and atomic databases.},

abstract = {The use of several uncertainty quantification and propagation methodologies is investigated in the context of the prompt fission neutron spectrum (PFNS) uncer- tainties and its impact on critical reactor assemblies. First, the first-order, linear Kalman filter is used as a nuclear data evaluation and uncertainty quantification tool combining available PFNS experimental data and a modified version of the Los Alamos (LA) model. The experimental covariance matrices, not generally given in the EXFOR database, are computed using the GMA methodology used by the IAEA to establish more appropriate correlations within each experiment. Then, using sys- tematics relating the LA model parameters across a suite of isotopes, the PFNS for both the uranium and plutonium actinides are evaluated leading to a new evaluation including cross-isotope correlations. Next, an alternative evaluation approach, the unified Monte Carlo (UMC) method, is studied for the evaluation of the PFNS for the n(0.5 MeV)239Pu fission reaction and compared to the Kalman filter. The UMC approach to nuclear data evaluation is implemented in a variety of ways to test con- vergence toward the Kalman filter results and to determine the nonlinearities present in the LA model. Ultimately, the UMC approach is shown to be comparable to the Kalman filter for a realistic data evaluation of the PFNS and is capable of captur- ing the nonlinearities present in the LA model. Next, the impact that the PFNS uncertainties have on important critical assemblies is investigated. Using the PFNS covariance matrices in the ENDF/B-VII.1 nuclear data library, the uncertainties of the effective multiplication factor, leakage, and spectral indices of the Lady Godiva and Jezebel critical assemblies are quantified. Using principal component analysis on the PFNS covariance matrices results in needing only 2–3 principal components to re- tain the PFNS uncertainties. Then, using the polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) on the uncertain output quantities, the stochastic collocation method (SCM) is used to compute the PCE coefficients. Compared to the “brute force” Monte Carlo forward propagation method, the PCE-SCM approach is shown to be capable of obtaining the same amount of output quantity uncertainty information with orders of magnitude computational savings. Finally, the uncertainties quantified in the correlated model parameters for the suite of uranium and plutonium actinides are propagated through the Big Ten and Flattop assemblies. In the case of the keff uncertainties in the Big Ten assembly, the uncorrelated PFNS uncertainties leads to 17.5{\%} smaller predicted uncertainties compared with the correlated PFNS uncertainties, suggesting the pres- ence of these cross-isotope correlations are important for this application. Last, the unified Monte Carlo + total Monte Carlo (UMC+TMC) method is implemented to propagate uncertainties from the prior LA model parameters through the Flattop critical assemblies. Due to the fact that cross-experiment correlations are neglected in all of the present evaluation work, the UMC+TMC suffers by predicting smaller uncertainties in the integral quantities by an order of magnitude or more compared to direct sampling from the posterior LA model parameters.},

abstract = {The USITER Project is responsible for providing a generic design of 18 diagnostics upper port plugs (UPPs). These plugs are designed to provide effective nuclear shielding, adequate nuclear heat removal capability, and allowance for personnel accessibility shortly after shutdown. In addition, the design limits for other parameters should not be exceeded during ITER lifetime. This includes the accumulative DPA and helium production in the UPP structure and the vacuum vessel, fast neutron fluence reaching the neighboring TF and PF magnets, and the accumulative local heating in their coil casings. In the present work, we assess these performance characteristics in three generic upper port plug (GUPP) designs of the in-plug shield and labyrinths that span possible configurations ranging from a conservative to worst case. The cases considered are: (1) Case A: "Visible-IR Camera diagnostic" with an intact port-attached blanket shield module (BSM), and (2) Case B: vis/IR system where the port-based BSM is replaced by overlapping adjacent vessel-attached BSM and (3) Case C: a "Large Aperture diagnostic" that is loosely resembles ECH style shielding plugs and aperture. These cases were modeled in a 20-degree sector of ITER.

@article{Jodrey1985,
abstract = {We have developed an algorithm which generates a random close packing of equal spheres from a random distribution of points. Each point is the center of an inner and an-outer sphere. The inner diameter defines the true density and the outer a nominal density. The algorithm eliminates over- laps among outer spheres while slowly shrinking the outer diameter. The two diameters approach each other, and the eventual coincidence of true and nominal densities terminates the procedure. The spheres in the packing, which is inherently homogeneous and isotropic, are close together but not touching. Thus, near neighbors are defined as those within a specified distance, 5, of touching. When the outer diameter is contracted relatively quickly, the number of near neighbors depends strongly on 6. As the contraction rate approaches zero, this dependence decreases sharply. We speculate that the limiting value is exactly 6 for all 5(10 . Packing fractions between 0.642 and 0.649, which are easily achieved by this method, are higher than any experimental or previously simulated values, but are consistent with Berryman's extrapolation [Phys. Rev. A 27, 1053 {\{}1983)] from the radial distribution function for hard spheres. The algorithm can also be used for packing hyperspheres in higher dimensions.}},

abstract = {This paper deals with a research activity performed in the frame of the breeding blankets design for nuclear fusion reactors, connected with the ITER experiment. In fact during the ITER operation, Test Blanket Modules (TBM) will be tested in the equatorial ports in order to determine their performances. The breeding blankets are presently developed for the DEMO reactor. One of the breeding blanket under study, called Helium Cooled Pebble Bed (HCPB), uses a solid breeder and a solid neutron multiplier in form of pebble beds. Lithium metatitanate (Li2TiO3) and lithium orthosilicate (Li4SiO4) are considered as the best candidate materials for solid breeder. The analysis of the breeding blanket is complex for the geometry as well as for the loading conditions. Advanced computer codes are needed in order to determine the reliability of the different designs. In this context, the mechanical characterization of pebble beds is important in order to simulate their behaviour. The objective of this research activity is to determine the effective properties of the pebble beds in order to develop a complete constitutive model of the granular material. In particular, with a resonant column device the effective shear modulus and the damping ratio have been determined. Moreover compression tests on single spheres have permitted to obtain the mechanical properties of the materials. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Mann2015,
abstract = {Understanding species extinction is a major concern today, and past extinctions provide valuable lessons. Numerous mammal species became extinct in the Arctic at the end of the ice age, but it is unclear why. By comparing numbers of dated bones with climate records, we find that megafaunal species, like mammoth, horse, and bison, experienced boom and bust cycles during the ice age as they tracked rapid climate changes. For these species to persist, long-distance dispersal was necessary. Their extinction on the North Slope occurred as the ice age ended, because rising sea level severed dispersal routes and spreading peat simultaneously degraded range quality. This finding suggests that arctic mammals can be resilient to environmental changes but only if their habitats remain widely interconnected.Understanding the population dynamics of megafauna that inhabited the mammoth steppe provides insights into the causes of extinctions during both the terminal Pleistocene and today. Our study area is Alaska{\{}$\backslash$textquoteright{\}}s North Slope, a place where humans were rare when these extinctions occurred. After developing a statistical approach to remove the age artifacts caused by radiocarbon calibration from a large series of dated megafaunal bones, we compare the temporal patterns of bone abundance with climate records. Megafaunal abundance tracked ice age climate, peaking during transitions from cold to warm periods. These results suggest that a defining characteristic of the mammoth steppe was its temporal instability and imply that regional extinctions followed by population reestablishment from distant refugia were characteristic features of ice-age biogeography at high latitudes. It follows that long-distance dispersal was crucial for the long-term persistence of megafaunal species living in the Arctic. Such dispersal was only possible when their rapidly shifting range lands were geographically interconnected. The end of the last ice age was fatally unique because the geographic ranges of arctic megafauna became permanently fragmented after stable, interglacial climate engendered the spread of peatlands at the same time that rising sea level severed former dispersal routes.},

Combined neutron transport and inventory simulations for representative {\{}$\backslash$it spatially heterogeneous{\}} models of a fusion power plant show that the production rate of Re is strongly influenced by the local spatial environment. Localised variation in neutron moderation (slowing down) due to structural steel and coolant, particularly water, can dramatically increase Re production because of the huge cross sections of giant resolved resonances in the neutron-capture reaction of $\backslash$({\^{}}{\{}186{\}}$\backslash$)W at low neutron energies. Calculations using cross section data corrected for temperature (Doppler) effects suggest that temperature may have a relatively lesser influence on transmutation rates.},

The static state neutronics analyses of a fusion power reactor (named FDS-II) have been carried out to find out the effects of the 1D/2D/3D geometric descriptions for computational models. The neutron wall loading distribution, tritium-breeding ratio and power density distribution are calculated to evaluate the nuclear performance using the Monte Carlo transport code MCNP4C and nuclear data library FENDL-2.1. Comparison of the results suggests that the value of TBR calculated by the 1D approach overestimates the tritium-breeding ratio especially in the inner blanket. The power density distribution based on the 2D and 3D models were similar since they all consider the effects of the axial components. For obtaining global scalar quantities for general use, simplified models of the fusion reactor are usually sufficient. However, more calculations are needed to test the validity of each model in different regions of phase space. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Neutron flux spectra and tritium production rates have been calculated using MCNP with a modified version of the ITER Alite torus sector model with integrated TBMs. Sensitivities of such parameters to nuclear cross sections of isotopes contained in the TBM as well as in the ITER device have been calculated using the Monte Carlo code MCSEN. Uncertainties could be obtained by using existing covariance data of the important nuclear cross section files, mainly from ENDF/B-VI, SCALE6.0, but also from recent JEFF/EFF evaluations.

abstract = {This paper presents a general overview of nuclear data evaluation and its applications as developed at NRG, Petten. Based on concepts such as robustness, reproducibility and automation, modern calculation tools are exploited to produce original nuclear data libraries that meet the current demands on quality and completeness. This requires a system which comprises differential measurements, theory development, nuclear model codes, resonance analysis, evaluation, ENDF formatting, data processing and integral validation in one integrated approach. Software, built around the TALYS code, will be presented in which all these essential nuclear data components are seamlessly integrated. Besides the quality of the basic data and its extensive format testing, a second goal lies in the diversity of processing for different type of users. The implications of this scheme are unprecedented. The most important are:. 1. Complete ENDF-6 nuclear data files, in the form of the TENDL library, including covariance matrices, for many isotopes, particles, energies, reaction channels and derived quantities. All isotopic data files are mutually consistent and are supposed to rival those of the major world libraries.2. More exact uncertainty propagation from basic nuclear physics to applied (reactor) calculations based on a Monte Carlo approach: "Total" Monte Carlo (TMC), using random nuclear data libraries.3. Automatic optimization in the form of systematic feedback from integral measurements back to the basic data. This method of work also opens a new way of approaching the analysis of nuclear applications, with consequences in both applied nuclear physics and safety of nuclear installations, and several examples are given here. This applied experience and feedback is integrated in a final step to improve the quality of the nuclear data, to change the users vision and finally to orchestrate their integration into simulation codes. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The DEMO plant will demonstrate by mid century the feasibility of electric power generation by nuclear fusion. Since 2011, conceptual design studies are coordinated by the EFDA Power Plant Physics and Technology (PPPT) Division, with the aim of identifying requirements, propose design approaches and start R{\&}D for the magnet system of DEMO. The input and generic boundary conditions are given by the system codes: the major radius of the tokamak is about 9 m. The proposed operating current at 13.6 T peak field is 82 kA, placing the DEMO TF conductor at substantially higher performance compared to ITER TF (68 kA/11.5 T). The innovative winding layout is a graded, layer wound with Nb 3Sn/NbTi hybridization, aiming at minimizing the size and the cost of the superconductor. Two options are considered for the Nb3Sn conductor: one a "wind{\&}react" cable-in-conduit (CICC) with reduced void fraction and rectangular shape. The other conductor is a "react{\&}wind" flat cable with copper segregation and thick steel conduit assembled by longitudinal weld. The conductor designs were first drafted in 2012 and updated in 2013 based on a first round of assessments, which includes electromagnetic, thermal-hydraulic and mechanical analysis. The manufacture of full size prototype conductors is planned in 2014. The technical requirement of the DEMO superconducting magnets is highlighted in comparison to ITER and other fusion devices. The large size of the DEMO tokamak is the main challenge for the demonstration of the feasibility of power generation by fusion. Together with the technical issues, the cost of the superconducting magnets will be eventually the crucial aspect to promote the establishment of nuclear fusion as a primary energy source in the coming centuries. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Multi-group theory is widely applied for the energy domain discretization when solving the Linear Boltzmann Equation. To reduce the computational cost, fine group cross libraries are often down-sampled into broad group cross section libraries. Cross section data collapsing generally involves two steps: Firstly, the broad group structure has to be determined; secondly, a weighting scheme is used to evaluate the broad cross section library based on the fine group cross section data and the broad group structure. A common scheme is to average the fine group cross section weighted by the fine group flux. Cross section collapsing techniques have been intensively researched. However, most studies use a pre-determined group structure, open based on experience, to divide the neutron energy spectrum into thermal, epi-thermal, fast, etc. energy range. In this paper, a swarm intelligence algorithm, particle swarm optimization (PSO), is applied to optimize the broad group structure. A graph representation of the broad group structure determination problem is introduced. And the swarm intelligence algorithm is used to solve the graph model. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated using a fuel-pin model. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

To remedy the energy self-shielding effect, homogeneous adjoint and forward B{\textless}inf{\textgreater}N{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} equations on an ultrafine energy group structure have been solved to obtain the ultrafine forward and adjoint spectra. The coarse group intervals are selected to have equal values of bilinear function in each energy interval. In order to verify the validity of the optimized structure, infinite multiplication factor and fission rate values are calculated using WIMSD5 code for two main types of thermal critical lattices: Mixed Oxide (MOX) and Uranium Oxide (UOX). A Comparison of the results with MCNP-4C code shows that the optimized 69 group structure improves the infinite multiplication factor and fission rate in the mentioned thermal lattices.},

In this paper, we describe two main features of voltage-current characteristic curves associated with the contaminated Langmuir probe, which are predicted from the equivalent circuit model, which we proposed in 1970's. We then show that fast sweeping dc Langmuir probes can give reliable results in the steady state regime. The fast sweeping probe can also give reliable results in transient situations such as satellite moves through plasma bubble in the ionosphere where the electron density drastically changes. This fact was first confirmed in our laboratory experiment.},

abstract = {Superthermal energetic particles (EP) often drive shear Alfv{\'{e}}n waves unstable in magnetically confined plasmas. These instabilities constitute a fascinating nonlinear system where fluid and kinetic nonlinearities can appear on an equal footing. In addition to basic science, Alfv{\'{e}}n instabilities are of practical importance, as the expulsion of energetic particles can damage the walls of a confinement device. Because of rapid dispersion, shear Alfv{\'{e}}n waves that are part of the continuous spectrum are rarely destabilized. However, because the index of refraction is periodic in toroidally confined plasmas, gaps appear in the continuous spectrum. At spatial locations where the radial group velocity vanishes, weakly damped discrete modes appear in these gaps. These eigenmodes are of two types. One type is associated with frequency crossings of counterpropagating waves; the toroidal Alfv{\'{e}}n eigenmode is a prominent example. The second type is associated with an extremum of the continuous spectrum; the reversed shear Alfv{\'{e}}n eigenmode is an example of this type. In addition to these normal modes of the background plasma, when the energetic particle pressure is very large, energetic particle modes that adopt the frequency of the energetic particle population occur. Alfv{\'{e}}n instabilities of all three types occur in every toroidal magnetic confinement device with an intense energetic particle population. The energetic particles are most conveniently described by their constants of motion. Resonances occur between the orbital frequencies of the energetic particles and the wave phase velocity. If the wave resonance with the energetic particle population occurs where the gradient with respect to a constant of motion is inverted, the particles transfer energy to the wave, promoting instability. In a tokamak, the spatial gradient drive associated with inversion of the toroidal canonical angular momentum is most important. Once a mode is driven unstable, a wide variety of nonlinear dynamics is observed, ranging from steady modes that gradually saturate, to bursting behavior reminiscent of relaxation oscillations, to rapid frequency chirping. An analogy to the classic one-dimensional problem of electrostatic plasma waves explains much of this phenomenology. EP transport can be convective, as when the wave scatters the particle across a topological boundary into a loss cone, or diffusive, which occurs when islands overlap in the orbital phase space. Despite a solid qualitative understanding of possible transport mechanisms, quantitative calculations using measured mode amplitudes currently underestimate the observed fast-ion transport. Experimentally, detailed identification of nonlinear mechanisms is in its infancy. Beyond validation of theoretical models, the future of the field lies in the development of control tools. These may exploit EP instabilities for beneficial purposes, such as favorably modifying the current profile, or use modest amounts of power to govern the nonlinear dynamics in order to avoid catastrophic bursts.},

abstract = {We replicate Reinhart and Rogoff (2010A and 2010B) and find that selective exclusion of available data, coding errors and inappropriate weighting of summary statistics lead to serious miscalculations that inaccurately represent the relationship between public debt and GDP growth among 20 advanced economies. Over 1946-2009, countries with public debt/GDP ratios above 90{\%} averaged 2.2{\%} real annual GDP growth, not -0.1{\%} as published. The published results for (i) median GDP growth rates for the 1946-2009 period and (ii) mean and median GDP growth figures over 1790-2009 are all distorted by similar methodological errors, although the magnitudes of the distortions are somewhat smaller than with the mean figures for 1946-2009. Contrary to Reinhart and Rogoff's broader contentions, both mean and median GDP growth when public debt levels exceed 90{\%} of GDP are not dramatically different from when the public debt/GDP ratios are lower. The relationship between public debt and GDP growth varies significantly by period and country. Our overall evidence refutes RR's claim that public debt/GDP ratios above 90{\%} consistently reduce a country's GDP growth.},

abstract = {Conceptual design activities of the first fusion power plants were launched in recent years with a view to putting them into operation by 2050. Nuclear fusion offers significant benefits in comparison with exploited energy sources, especially limitless fuel reserves, inherent nuclear safety, and negligible impact on the environment. The challenge is a high heat and neutron loading of the fusion reactors nuclear zone. The paper brings the ex-ante economic analysis of the fusion power plant model DEMO2 in terms of the cost of electricity. The model investment and operating costs are presented. The limit sales price of electricity was found using the net present value method. The levelized cost of electricity LCOE method with the inclusion of external costs is used for a comparison of selected power plant types based on the OECD statistical data and the EU ExternE project results. The comparison shows the levelized cost of electricity of fusion power plants competitive to the actual renewable resources. After internalisation of external costs, the fusion power plants should become even the second cheapest power source.},

abstract = {A neutronics experiment has been performed in the frame of European Fusion Technology Program on a mock-up of the EU Test Blanket Module (TBM), HCPB concept, with the objective to validate the capability of nuclear data to predict nuclear responses, such as the tritium production rate (TPR), with qualified uncertainties. In the experiment, the TPR has been measured using Li2CO3 pellets located at various depths at two symmetrical positions at each depth, one in the upper and one in the lower breeder cassette. Three independent measurements were performed by ENEA, TUD/VKTA and JAEA. The neutron flux in the beryllium layer was measured as well using activation foils. The measured tritium production in the TBM (E) was compared with the same quantity (C) calculated by the MCNP-4C code using a very detailed model of the experimental set up. A sensitivity and uncertainty analysis has also been performed to evaluate the calculation uncertainty due to the uncertainty on neutron cross sections. The results of such analysis, carried out using both Monte Carlo and deterministic codes, shows that the uncertainty due to cross sections amounts to 4-5{\%} (2$\sigma$). C/E ratios were obtained with a total uncertainty on the C/E comparison of 9-10{\%} (2$\sigma$). The C/E comparison shows that the calculation of the tritium production is underestimated by about 10{\%} in average and is within the combined 2$\sigma$ uncertainty margin of the measurements and the calculations. The obtained results indicate that design calculations of the tritium breeding ratio provide conservative results for the fusion reactor employing a HCPB type breeder blanket. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We describe the physics and data included in the Reference Input Parameter Library, which is devoted to input parameters needed in calculations of nuclear reactions and nuclear data evaluations. Advanced modelling codes require substantial numerical input, therefore the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has worked extensively since 1993 on a library of validated nuclear-model input parameters, referred to as the Reference Input Parameter Library (RIPL). A final RIPL coordinated research project (RIPL-3) was brought to a successful conclusion in December 2008, after 15 years of challenging work carried out through three consecutive IAEA projects. The RIPL-3 library was released in January 2009, and is available on the Web through http://www-nds.iaea.org/RIPL-3/. This work and the resulting database are extremely important to theoreticians involved in the development and use of nuclear reaction modelling (ALICE, EMPIRE, GNASH, UNF, TALYS) both for theoretical research and nuclear data evaluations. The numerical data and computer codes included in RIPL-3 are arranged in seven segments: MASSES contains ground-state properties of nuclei for about 9000 nuclei, including three theoretical predictions of masses and the evaluated experimental masses of Audi et al. (2003). DISCRETE LEVELS contains 117 datasets (one for each element) with all known level schemes, electromagnetic and $\gamma$-ray decay probabilities available from ENSDF in October 2007. NEUTRON RESONANCES contains average resonance parameters prepared on the basis of the evaluations performed by Ignatyuk and Mughabghab. OPTICAL MODEL contains 495 sets of phenomenological optical model parameters defined in a wide energy range. When there are insufficient experimental data, the evaluator has to resort to either global parameterizations or microscopic approaches. Radial density distributions to be used as input for microscopic calculations are stored in the MASSES segment. LEVEL DENSITIES contains phenomenological parameterizations based on the modified Fermi gas and superfluid models and microscopic calculations which are based on a realistic microscopic single-particle level scheme. Partial level densities formulae are also recommended. All tabulated total level densities are consistent with both the recommended average neutron resonance parameters and discrete levels. GAMMA contains parameters that quantify giant resonances, experimental gamma-ray strength functions and methods for calculating gamma emission in statistical model codes. The experimental GDR parameters are represented by Lorentzian fits to the photo-absorption cross sections for 102 nuclides ranging from51V to239Pu. FISSION includes global prescriptions for fission barriers and nuclear level densities at fission saddle points based on microscopic HFB calculations constrained by experimental fission cross sections. {\textcopyright} 2009.},

The mock-up dimensions and materials composition are consistent with the current ITER design. The primary objective of the experiment was to validate the MCNP calculations (C) of nuclear heating measured (E) in the region corresponding to the ITER Toroidal Field (TF) coil. An accuracy on C/E ratio of 10{\%} was required. The neutronics and shielding properties of the mock-up were also studied throughout the measurement of selected activation reaction rates up to about 1 m depth. Due to the very low activity induced in the foils, the measurements in the deepest experimental positions were performed at the underground low background facility of the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso, using ultra-low background high purity germanium (HPGe) detectors. The measured reaction rates and nuclear heating were thus compared with the results of the Monte Carlo code MCNP5 coupled with the FENDL-2.1 library. 2012 EURATOM ENEA Association.},

Bremsstrahlung losses for all of these fueis have been calculated in a general fashion which applies not only to IEC systems but also to most other fusion schemes; these calculations indicate that bremsstrahlung losses will be prohibitively large for 3He-3He, p-lB, and p-6Li reactors and will be a considerable fraction of the fusion power for D-sHe and D-D reactors. Further calculations show that it d{\&}not -ap{\&}r possible for the dense central region of a reactor-grade IEC device to maintain significantly non-Maxwe{\%}in ion distributions or to keep two different ion species at significantly different temperatures, in contradiction with earlier claims made about such systems. Since the ions form a Maxwellian distribution with a mean energy. not very much smaller than iihe electrostatic well depth, ions in the energetic tail of the distribution will be lost at rates greatly in excess of the fusion rate. Even by using one of the best electron confinement systems proposed for such devices, a polyhedral cusp magnetic field, and by making exceedingly optimistic assumptions about the performance of that confinement system, the electron losses from the machine prove to be intolerable for all fuels except perhaps DT. In order for IEC systems to be used as fusion reactors,it will be necessary to find methods to circumvent these problems.},

Fast-ion redistribution due to frequency-chirping TAE in the range 50 kHz to 100 kHz, and frequency-chirping energetic particle modes known as fishbones in the range 20 kHz to 50 kHz, is observed. TAE and fishbones are also observed to cause losses of fast ions from the plasma. The spatial and temporal evolution of the fast-ion distribution is determined using a fission chamber, a radially-scanning collimated neutron flux monitor, a fast-ion deuterium alpha spectrometer and a charged fusion product detector. Modelling using the global transport analysis code TRANSP, with ad hoc anomalous diffusion and fishbone loss models introduced, reproduces the coarsest features of the affected fast-ion distribution in the presence of energetic-particle-driven modes. The spectrally and spatially resolved measurements show however that these models do not fully capture the effects of chirping modes on the fast-ion distribution.},

Much progress has been achieved in this area over the past decade, largely as result of the effort spent by the national fusion technology programmes in the EU, Japan, the RF and the US and supported by the international thermonuclear experimental reactor (ITER) project. In conjunction with the conduction of various integral benchmark experiments, this has led to the development of a well-qualified nuclear database for fusion applications, the international fusion evaluated nuclear data library (FENDL), and the assessment of safety margins derived for reactor design relevant responses. Further development work is required to enable direct uncertainty calculations for fusion reactor applications. This requires a Monte Carlo code capable for full sensitivity and uncertainty calculations along with high-quality, co-variance data as well as suitable integral benchmark experiments for qualification and validation purposes. This proceeding will allow specifying, by Monte Carlo calculations, the design relevant responses with their associated uncertainties and thus directly providing the related design safety margins.},

abstract = {One of the primary functions of a fusion blanket is to generate enough tritium to make a fusion power plant (FPP) self-sufficient. To ensure that there is satisfactory tritium production in a real plant the tritium breeding ratio (TBR) in the blanket must be greater than 1+M, where M is the breeding margin. For solid-type blanket designs, the initial TBR must be significantly higher than 1+M, since the blanket TBR will be reduced over time as the lithium fuel is consumed. The rate of TBR reduction will impact on the overall blanket self-sufficiency time, the time in which the net tritium inventory of the system is positive. DEMO relevant blanket materials, Li4SiO4 and Li2TiO3, are investigated by computational simulation using radiation transport tools coupled with time-dependent inventory calculations. The results include tritium inventory assessments and depletion of breeding materials over time, which enable self-sufficiency times and maximum surplus tritium inventories to be evaluated, which are essential quantities to determine to allow one to design a credible FPP using solid-type breeding material concepts. The blanket concepts investigated show self-sufficiency times of several years in some cases and maximum surplus inventories of up to a few tens of kg.},

During preparation, commissioning and operating phases, components can be virtually tested by using validated numerical models, operational expertise, and experimental databases. Three complementary applications have been developed under this approach. The numerical models used for the divertor tiles are based on continuum mechanics formulations. Their loading conditions are defined using the current physics and engineering understanding of a combination of experimental measurements. The aim of these tools is to increase operational range, reliability, and predictability of the JET divertor.},

abstract = {Fispact-II is a code system and library database for modelling activation-transmutation processes, depletion-burn-up, time dependent inventory and radiation damage source terms caused by nuclear reactions and decays. The Fispact-II code, written in object-style Fortran, follows the evolution of material irradiated by neutrons, alphas, gammas, protons, or deuterons, and provides a wide range of derived radiological output quantities to satisfy most needs for nuclear applications. It can be used with any ENDF-compliant group library data for nuclear reactions, particle-induced and spontaneous fission yields, and radioactive decay (including but not limited to TENDL-2015, ENDF/B-VII.1, JEFF-3.2, JENDL-4.0u, CENDL-3.1 processed into fine-group-structure files, GEFY-5.2 and UKDD-16), as well as resolved and unresolved resonance range probability tables for self-shielding corrections and updated radiological hazard indices. The code has many novel features including: extension of the energy range up to 1 GeV; additional neutron physics including self-shielding effects, temperature dependence, thin and thick target yields; pathway analysis; and sensitivity and uncertainty quantification and propagation using full covariance data. The latest ENDF libraries such as TENDL encompass thousands of target isotopes. Nuclear data libraries for Fispact-II are prepared from these using processing codes PREPRO, NJOY and CALENDF. These data include resonance parameters, cross sections with covariances, probability tables in the resonance ranges, PKA spectra, kerma, dpa, gas and radionuclide production and energy-dependent fission yields, supplemented with all 27 decay types. All such data for the five most important incident particles are provided in evaluated data tables. The Fispact-II simulation software is described in detail in this paper, together with the nuclear data libraries. The Fispact-II system also includes several utility programs for code-use optimisation, visualisation and production of secondary radiological quantities. Included in the paper are summaries of results from the suite of verification and validation reports available with the code.},

Dedicated chapters focus on the physics of confinement, the equilibrium and stability of tokamaks, diagnostics, heating and current drive by neutral beam and radiofrequency waves, and plasma–wall interactions. While the tokamak is a leading concept for the realization of fusion, other concepts (helical confinement and, in a broader sense, other magnetic and inertial configurations) are also addressed in the book. At over 1100 pages, this publication provides an unparalleled resource for fusion physicists and engineers.},

abstract = {The dominating fraction of the power generated by fusion in the reactor is captured by neutron moderation in the blanket surrounding the plasma. From this, the efficiency of the fusion plant is predominated by the technologies applied to make electricity or hydrogen from the neutrons. The main blanket concepts addressed in this paper are advanced ceramic breeder concepts, dual coolant blankets as well as self-cooled liquid metal and Flibe blankets. Two important questions that are addressed are: (i) Can we draw a bottom line conclusion on the most promising concept(s)? (ii) What are the common issues to be resolved independently from individual design and layout proposals to define a feasible route towards advanced fusion reactors? For ceramic breeder concepts, a key issue in the long term could be the limitation of beryllium as the considered multiplier in terms of world sources and achievable temperature levels. For liquid metal blankets, attractive long-term visions have been developed but major technological challenges also exist for the in-vessel blanket technology and the corresponding sub-systems. The paper proposes a strategic conclusion derived from the review of blanket designs for advanced fusion reactors. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A supercritical recompression CO2 power cycle has been simulated using the system code RELAP5–3D. This code is being developed by INL and has traditionally been used in the simulation of operational and accidental transients in fission nuclear plants. The aim of the work presented here, developed within the framework of the Spanish Fusion Technology Program Consolider TECNO{\_}FUS, is to take advantage of the simulation capabilities of RELAP5–3D in a field where little if any experience exists in the use of the code; i.e., the simulation of the heat fluxes and the thermodynamic cycle that, in a fusion power plant, will convert thermal power from plasma into mechanical power as a previous step to electricity generation. Code capabilities that make it suitable for this purpose are, for instance, the compressor model and the libraries of fluid properties (among them CO2 and LiPb). The reference plant for the simulation is the one being designed under TECNO{\_}FUS, which is the Spanish proposal for DEMO. The model of the plant includes the primary coolant systems, i.e. helium and LiPb in the Spanish dual coolant modular design (doble refrigerante modular, DRM), compressors, turbine and heat exchangers (Printed Circuit type). After the model has been set-up, several steady-state calculations have been run to test the performance of the model. After designing some minimal control features and adjusting their parameters, a few transient calculations have been run in order to demonstrate the capabilities of code and model. Finally, strengths and weaknesses of code and model are highlighted, along with some conclusions on their suitability for fusion technology applications.},

abstract = {Since 2009, the Working Group on the ‘Anthropocene' (or, commonly, AWG for Anthropocene Working Group), has been critically analysing the case for formalization of this proposed but still informal geological time unit. The study to date has mainly involved establishing the overall nature of the Anthropocene as a potential chronostratigraphic/geochronologic unit, and exploring the stratigraphic proxies, including several that are novel in geology, that might be applied to its characterization and definition. A preliminary summary of evidence and interim recommendations was presented by the Working Group at the 35th International Geological Congress in Cape Town, South Africa, in August 2016, together with results of voting by members of the AWG indicating the current balance of opinion on major questions surrounding the Anthropocene. The majority opinion within the AWG holds the Anthropocene to be stratigraphically real, and recommends formalization at epoch/series rank based on a mid-20th century boundary. Work is proceeding towards a formal proposal based upon selection of an appropriate Global boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP), as well as auxiliary stratotypes. Among the array of proxies that might be used as a primary marker, anthropogenic radionuclides associated with nuclear arms testing are the most promising; potential secondary markers include plastic, carbon isotope patterns and industrial fly ash. All these proxies have excellent global or near-global correlation potential in a wide variety of sedimentary bodies, both marine and non-marine.},

Tritium self-sufficiency is one of the most important issues for CFETR and the tritium breeding ratio (TBR) is recommended not less than 1.2. As one of the candidates, a helium cooled solid breeder blanket for CFETR superconducting tokamak option was proposed. In the concept, radial arranged U-shaped breeding zones are adopted for higher TBR and simpler structure. In this work, three-dimensional neutronics design and analysis of the blanket were performed using the Monte Carlo N-Particle transport code MCNP with IAEA data library FENDL-2.1. Tritium breeding capability of the proposed blanket was assessed and the breeding zones parallel to first wall (FW) and perpendicular to FW were optimized. Meanwhile, the nuclear heating analysis and shielding performance were also presented for later thermal and structural analysis. The results showed that the blanket could well meet the tritium self-sufficiency target and the neutron shield could satisfy the design requirements.},

abstract = {The lithium ceramic and beryllium pebble beds of the breeder units (BU), in the fusion breeding blanket, are purged by helium to extract the bred tritium. Therefore, the objective of this study is to support the design of the BU purge gas system by studying the effect of pebbles diameter, packing factor, pebble bed length, and flow inlet pressure on the purge gas pressure drop. The pebble bed was formed by packing glass pebbles in a rectangular container (56 mm × 206 mm × 396 mm) and was integrated into a gas loop to be purged by helium at BU-relevant pressures (1.1-3.8 bar). To determine the pressure drop across the pebble bed, the static pressure was measured at four locations along the pebble bed as well as at the inlet and outlet locations. The results show: (i) the pressure drop significantly increases with decreasing the pebbles diameter and slightly increases with increasing the packing factor, (ii) for a constant inlet flow velocity, the pressure drop is directly proportional to the pebble bed length and inlet pressure, and (iii) predictions of Ergun's equation agree well with the experimental values of the pressure drop. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} Owned by the authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2010. Evaluated nuclear data rather than raw experimental and theoretical information are employed in nuclear applications such as the design of nuclear energy systems. Therefore, the process by which such information is produced and ultimately used is of critical interest to the nuclear science community. This paper provides an overview of various contemporary methods employed to generate evaluated cross sections and related physical quantities such as particle emission angular distributions and energy spectra. The emphasis here is on data associated with neutron induced reaction processes, with consideration of the uncertainties in these data, and on the more recent evaluation methods, e.g., those that are based on stochastic (Monte Carlo) techniques. There is no unique way to perform such evaluations, nor are nuclear data evaluators united in their opinions as to which methods are superior to the others in various circumstances. In some cases it is not critical which approaches are used as long as there is consistency and proper use is made of the available physical information. However, in other instances there are definite advantages to using particular methods as opposed to other options. Some of these distinctions are discussed in this paper and suggestions are offered regarding fruitful areas for future research in the development of evaluation methodology.},

abstract = {Experiments and three-dimensional (3D) numerical simulations are performed to investigate the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) characteristics of liquid metal (LM) flows of molten lead-lithium (PbLi) eutectic alloy in an electrically conducting circular duct subjected to a transverse non-uniform (fringing) magnetic field. An indirect measurement approach for differential pressure in high temperature LM PbLi is first developed, and then detailed data on pressure drop in this PbLi MHD flow are measured. The obtained experimental results for the pressure distribution are in good agreement with numerical simulations. Using the numerical simulation results, the 3D effects caused by fringing magnetic field on the LM flow are illustrated via distributions for the axial pressure gradients and transverse pressure differences. It has been verified that a simple approach for estimation of pressure drop in LM MHD flow in a fringing magnetic field proposed by Miyazaki et al. [22] i.e., a simple integral of pressure gradient along the fringing field zone using a quasi-fully- developed flow assumption, is also applicable to the conditions of the present experiment providing the magnetic interaction parameter is large enough. Furthermore, for two different sections of the LM flow at the entry to and at the exit from the magnet, it is found that the pressure distributions in the duct cross sections in these two regions are different. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In this work, the effects of neutron energy-group structures and resonance treatments on the main integral neutronic parameters are investigated in a fusion-fission hybrid reactor, which has a fast and a thermal blanket fuelling with ThO2. A D-T fusion neutron (14.1 MeV) is used as a neutron source. Fissile zone is cooled: (a) with light water for the moderated blanket and (b) with pressurized helium gas for the fast blanket. The neutronic parameters have been evaluated with and without a resonance treatment for the same blanket compositions for the sake of a consistent comparison. The study has shown that neutron reactions above a threshold energy in fast neutron groups are less sensitive to resonance treatment, such as 7Li(n,??n') T and 232Th(n,f). Neutron energy-group structures in the neutron libraries and description ef fusion neutron source spectrum mainly affect these reactions. On the other hand, neutron reactions in the resonance and thermal energy groups are sensitive to resonance treatment, such as 6Li(n,??) T and 232Th(n,??), depending on the resonance structures. In the fast blanket calculations, resonance-based errors are lower and neutron source based errors are higher than in the moderated blanket. Further-more, a correct description of the fusion neutron source spectrum over several neutron energy groups is essential to calculate fission reaction rates, fission heating density, fosile and fissile breeding rates and neutron leakage accurately. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The Helium Cooled Lithium Lead (HCLL) blanket is one of the candidate European blanket concepts selected for the DEMOnstration fusion power plant that should follow ITER. In a fusion power plant, the blanket is one of the key components because of its impact on the plant performance, availability, safety and economics. In 2012, the European Fusion Development Agreement (EFDA) agency issued new specifications for DEMO: this paper describes the work performed to adapt the previous 2007 HCLL-DEMO blanket design to those specifications. A new segmentation has been defined assuming straight surfaces for all blanket modules. Following the Multi Module Segment (MMS) option, all modules are attached to a common back supporting structure which also serves as manifold for Helium and PbLi distribution. A detailed CAD design of the central outboard module has been defined. Thermo-hydraulic and thermo-mechanical analyses on of the First Wall and Breeder Zone have been carried out. For the attachment of the modules to the common backplate, a new solution based on the use of Tie Rods, derived from the design of the corresponding HCLL Test Blanket Module for ITER, has been proposed. This paper also identifies the priorities for further development of the HCLL blanket design. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The modeling of the component material composition during and after the fusion energy power plant's operational lifetime is required for radiation protection, fuel cycle, radioactive waste disposal and reactor performance. The computational load and accuracy of the models are dependant on the method of reaction rate calculation. The generation of reaction rates within Monte-Carlo (MC) transport codes can be accomplished via (1) the standard point-wise estimator approach of tallying the pointwise flux and pointwise partial cross sections and/or (2) the multigroup approach which convolves a pointwise neutron flux with pre-defined binned partial cross-sections. Even fine multigroup sampling is more efficient when compared to pointwise Monte-Carlo sampling due to the removal of the cross-section interpolation from the calculation. This paper describes the four stage optimization procedure used to find an energy binning format which enables an accurate enough and computationally efficient calculation of any reaction rate when applied to MC modeling of IFE/MFE devices. This optimum format, named FOMG (Fusion Optimised Multi-Group), was evaluated using a SINBAD (Shielding Integral Benchmark Archive Database) benchmark. Despite the number of multi-group bins exceeding the number of data elements for a significant number of the ENDF files the MCNP simulation took more than one hundred times longer to calculate reaction rates using the pointwise approach when compared to the multi-group method with FOMG structure.},

abstract = {Late Pleistocene extinctions are of interest to paleontological and anthropological research. In North America and Australia, human occupation occurred during a short period of time and overexploitation may have led to the extinction of mammalian megafauna. In northern Eurasia megafaunal extinctions are believed to have occurred over a relatively longer period of time, perhaps as a result of changing environmental conditions, but the picture is much less clear. To consider megafaunal extinction in Eurasia, we compare differences in the geographical distribution and commonness of extinct and extant species between paleontological and archaeological localities from the late middle Pleistocene to Holocene. Purely paleontological localities, as well as most extinct species, were distributed north of archaeological sites and of the extant species, suggesting that apart from possible differences in adaptations between humans and other species, humans could also have a detrimental effect on large mammal distribution. However, evidence for human overexploitation applies only to the extinct steppe bison Bison priscus. Other human-preferred species survive into the Holocene, including Rangifer tarandus, Equus ferus, Capreolus capreolus, Cervus elaphus, Equus hemionus, Saiga tatarica, and Sus scrofa. Mammuthus primigenius and Megaloceros giganteus were rare in archaeological sites. Carnivores appear little influenced by human presence, although they become rarer in Holocene archaeological sites. Overall, the data are consistent with the conclusion that humans acted as efficient hunters selecting for the most abundant species. Our study supports the idea that the late Pleistocene extinctions were environmentally driven by climatic changes that triggered habitat fragmentation, species range reduction, and population decrease, after which human interference either by direct hunting or via indirect activities probably became critical. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In a pebble-bed core not only the fuel and moderator pebbles are randomly packed, but also the fuel-to-moderator pebble ratio is irregular. It is quite difficult to directly apply these features in MCNP??? simulations. A new method, that can efficiently simulate the characteristics of the pebble-bed core by using the MCNP??? code, was developed in this study. The key idea of the method is that the material composing the unit cell expanded by repeated-geometry feature of the code is randomly determined and the continuity of material is conserved. This method was validated by the benchmark problems for the pebble-bed cores. If this method is implemented into the MCNP??? code, greater variety of analyses for the pebble-bed core can be possible. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The ENDF/B-VII.1 library is our latest recommended evaluated nuclear data file for use in nuclear science and technology applications, and incorporates advances made in the five years since the release of ENDF/B-VII.0. These advances focus on neutron cross sections, covariances, fission product yields and decay data, and represent work by the US Cross Section Evaluation Working Group (CSEWG) in nuclear data evaluation that utilizes developments in nuclear theory, modeling, simulation, and experiment. The principal advances in the new library are: (1) An increase in the breadth of neutron reaction cross section coverage, extending from 393 nuclides to 423 nuclides; (2) Covariance uncertainty data for 190 of the most important nuclides, as documented in companion papers in this edition; (3) R-matrix analyses of neutron reactions on light nuclei, including isotopes of He, Li, and Be; (4) Resonance parameter analyses at lower energies and statistical high energy reactions for isotopes of Cl, K, Ti, V, Mn, Cr, Ni, Zr and W; (5) Modifications to thermal neutron reactions on fission products (isotopes of Mo, Tc, Rh, Ag, Cs, Nd, Sm, Eu) and neutron absorber materials (Cd, Gd); (6) Improved minor actinide evaluations for isotopes of U, Np, Pu, and Am (we are not making changes to the major actinides235,238U and239Pu at this point, except for delayed neutron data and covariances, and instead we intend to update them after a further period of research in experiment and theory), and our adoption of JENDL-4.0 evaluations for isotopes of Cm, Bk, Cf, Es, Fm, and some other minor actinides; (7) Fission energy release evaluations; (8) Fission product yield advances for fission-spectrum neutrons and 14 MeV neutrons incident on239Pu; and (9) A new decay data sublibrary. Integral validation testing of the ENDF/B-VII.1 library is provided for a variety of quantities: For nuclear criticality, the VII.1 library maintains the generally-good performance seen for VII.0 for a wide range of MCNP simulations of criticality benchmarks, with improved performance coming from new structural material evaluations, especially for Ti, Mn, Cr, Zr and W. For Be we see some improvements although the fast assembly data appear to be mutually inconsistent. Actinide cross section updates are also assessed through comparisons of fission and capture reaction rate measurements in critical assemblies and fast reactors, and improvements are evident. Maxwellian-averaged capture cross sections at 30 keV are also provided for astrophysics applications. We describe the cross section evaluations that have been updated for ENDF/B-VII.1 and the measured data and calculations that motivated the changes, and therefore this paper augments the ENDF/B-VII.0 publication. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {In an irradiation experiment using a LiAl/Pb assembly, we found out that the neutron flux inside the assembly calculated with JENDL-3.3 underestimates an experimental value in the 10-16 MeV region by around 30{\%} and that in the 0.5-5 MeV region by around 15{\%}, while the calculated flux with JEFF-3.1 overestimates the measurement in the 5-10 MeV region by around 20{\%}. In order to reveal a reason of the discrepancy, problems of the nuclear data libraries for lead were investigated. As a result, the following problems of the evaluated libraries were pointed out: the cross-sections of the (n,2n) reaction in JENDL-3.3 for lead isotopes are too large and cause a significant underestimation of the neutron flux above 10 MeV, which appeared in the analysis of the above experiment. Inelastic scattering data for 208Pb in JENDL-3.3 reproduce previous experimental double-differential cross-section data most well. However, those for the other lead isotopes have some problems and cause a large underestimation of the neutron flux from 0.5 to 5 MeV. The reason of the overestimation in the energy region of 5-10 MeV with JEFF-3.1 is still unclear. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Two variants have been developed over the years: {\$}(i){\$} The "calculable" {\$}R{\$}-matrix method is a calculational tool to derive scattering properties from the Schr$\backslash$"odinger equation in a large variety of physical problems. It was developed rather independently in atomic and nuclear physics with too little mutual influence. {\$}(ii){\$} The "phenomenological" {\$}R{\$}-matrix method is a technique to parametrize various types of cross sections. It was mainly (or uniquely) used in nuclear physics. Both directions are explained by starting from the simple problem of scattering by a potential. They are illustrated by simple examples in nuclear and atomic physics. In addition to elastic scattering, the {\$}R{\$}-matrix formalism is applied to transfer and radiative-capture reactions.

abstract = {In HCPB blankets, pebble beds are composed of nearly spherical particles in the state of random closed packing. The packing structure is important to understand responses of pebble beds, e.g., mechanical stresses and effective thermal conductivity. In this paper, an algorithm for random close packing of polydisperse particles is presented which can be used for arbitrary pebble bed containing geometries. The microstructure of a packed bed in both the bulk and near-wall regions can be determined. Computer- generated samples are compared to recent X-ray tomography results of non-compressed pebble beds, including the packing factors and coordination number. Moreover, initial configurations obtained by this method can be used in discrete element simulations of random configurations of pebbles to investigate the overall behaviour of pebble beds under fusion-relevant conditions.},

abstract = {Beryllium is expected to be one of the materials used in DEMO-type fusion power plants as blanket neutron multiplier for solid breeders and also in ITER as protective layer of plasma facing components. Among the aspects to be considered when dealing with Be a relevant one is its impurities content. One of the impurity reported by manufacturers is uranium, and that could represent a main source of concern, because its irradiation under fusion neutrons will lead to the formation of actinides, such as plutonium. The paper presents a parametric assessment utilizing for beryllium material composition a range of possible U impurity content between 0 and 100 ppmwt. First Wall neutron wall load ranging from 0.5 to 2.2MW/m2and neutron fluence from 0.5 to 10.5MWyear/m2are considered (for ITER and DEMO-type reactor, respectively) to estimate the Pu production. In all those analyses the irradiation scenarios considered are based on a deuterium-tritium plasma. The evaluation have been performed using the EASY-2007 activation code package, with the EAF2007 activation library. An estimate of the Pu production at the end of the ITER fusion machine preliminary operation with deuterium-deuterium plasma is also presented. A preliminary analysis of the regulatory constraints on the maximum Pu production and indications of possible way for its minimisation is presented and discussed in the paper. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Nuclear data are of fundamental importance in studies of nuclear technology. In these studies, experiments to measure cross sections and decay properties and simulations of the design of fission power plants, fusion devices and accelerators are included. The large amount of data required is stored in computer readable formats in data libraries and the most common of these are the general purpose files used for neutronics or transport calculations. These files also contain the standards against which most measurements are made. The other class of libraries are the special purpose ones containing decay data, fission yields and cross section data for dosimetry and activation. This paper gives examples of what data are available and describes their use for various fusion applications. The focus will be on neutron-induced activation data with examples of how the reactions of particular importance can be identified. All data should be accompanied by estimates of the uncertainty. This is best achieved by including covariance data; however, this is extremely challenging and only a subset of the available data has such uncertainty data. The general principles of how covariance matrices are used are outlined. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In the nuclear industry, an increased demand exists to provide modeling results with credible confidence bounds not only for simple but also for refined modeling. With the objective to facilitate and promote such analysis, a user-friendly and complete computer code package was developed comprising the multidimensional cross-section sensitivity and uncertainty code package SUSD3D, the secondary angular distribution (SAD) covariance data-processing module ERRORR34, and the cross-section covariance matrix library ZZ-VITAMIN-J/COVA. The discrete ordinates sensitivity formulation of the first-order perturbation theory is implemented in the SUSD3D code. Much effort was devoted to mitigate some drawbacks of the discrete ordinates-based sensitivity analysis, in particular to allow the analysis of complex geometries and to reduce memory requirements. The SUSD3D code is linked via interface files to a wide range of state-of-the-art transport codes suitable for complex radiation transport and facility design studies (like ANISN, DOT-3.5, DANTSYS, DORT, and TORT) and supports the new cross-section and covariance data formats. The SAD and secondary energy distribution effects can be taken into account. The complete SAD covariance matrices, as available in the European Fusion File evaluations (EFF-2 and -3) can be treated. The computer codes are written in FORTRAN-77 and run under DOS (PC), UNIX (workstations), VMS (VAX), and other compatible operating systems. The code system is extensively used to study fission- and fusion-related problems. The validation and several practical applications of the package are presented, including the reactor pressure vessel surveillance uncertainty studies, and ASPIS-iron, VENUS-3, and FNG benchmark experiment analyses.},

abstract = {We report in this paper the test results of the Langmuir Probes (LPs) that have been used on several Korean low earth orbit (LEO) satellites since 1999. The probes were designed to measure the electrons in the density range of ∼104 to ∼106/cm3 and temperatures less than ∼104 K, which are the typical characteristics of the upper ionosphere. Careful considerations were given to the probe design to reduce many error sources. For example, a 10 Hz fast voltage sweep was applied to the probe to minimize measurement errors caused by probe contaminations. An electron temperature probe was installed in addition to the LP on the KOMPSAT-1, and the electron temperatures measured simultaneously and independently by the two instruments were compared. The results showed good agreement, which confirms the validity of the LP data obtained from these Korean satellites.},

@article{Bradshaw2011,
abstract = {An acceptable criterion for strong sustainability in the consumption of natural resources is an effective, or virtual, limitlessness of supply, which can be defined, albeit arbitrarily, as corresponding to a few million years. The fuels for nuclear fusion - lithium and deuterium - satisfy this condition because of the abundance of lithium in seawater and of deuterium in all forms of water. The possible use of lithium-ion batteries on a large scale, particularly in the automobile industry, could, however, use up all the known terrestrial reserves and resources of lithium in the next few decades. Little attention has been paid so far to the financial, energetic, and above all, environmental aspects of lithium extraction from seawater. The neutron multipliers foreseen for fusion power plants, in particular beryllium, represent a major supply problem and require that other, sustainable solutions be urgently sought. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Hogenbirk1991,
abstract = {The results are presented of a sensitivity and uncertainty analysis of a NET iron/water inboard shielding blanket using energy self-shielded cross sections. Coupled (n, ??) transport calculations were performed in an S8P3 approximation using cross sections derived from the European Fusion File in the 121-group GAM-II structure. Energy self-shielding was taken into account using the Bondarenko method. The results of this analysis are compared with a similar analysis in which infinite dilute cross sections were used. It is shown that the effect of energy self-shielding on the neutron flux in the coils of the NET design is considerable, whereas the ??-flux is hardly influenced at all. This causes the nuclear heating in the inboard coils to be increased by 13{\%}. The relative uncertainty in the nuclear heating due to uncertainties in the total cross sections of Fe, Cr and Ni decreases by 8{\%} when self-shielding is taken into account. In addition, the effects of uncertainties in the energy and angular distributions of the scattered neutrons (SED and SAD respectively) were studied. SED uncertainties appear to have only a minor effect. SAD uncertainties, however, are quite important for elastic scattering. It is therefore concluded that more attention should be paid to these SAD uncertainties. ?? 1991.},

abstract = {Neutron measurements using neutron activation systems are an essential part of the diagnostic system at large fusion machines such as JET and ITER. Nuclear data is used to infer the neutron yield. Consequently, high-quality nuclear data is essential for the proper determination of the neutron yield and fusion power. However, uncertainties due to nuclear data are not fully taken into account in uncertainty analysis for neutron yield calibrations using activation foils. This paper investigates the neutron yield uncertainty due to nuclear data using the so-called Total Monte Carlo Method. The work is performed using a detailed MCNP model of the JET fusion machine; the uncertainties due to the cross-sections and angular distributions in JET structural materials, as well as the activation cross-sections in the activation foils, are analysed. It is found that a significant contribution to the neutron yield uncertainty can come from uncertainties in the nuclear data. {\textcopyright} The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2017.},

For this purpose, activation cross-sections were taken from the International Reactor Dosimetry and Fusion File (IRDFF-v1.05) in 640 groups ENDF-6 format for several reactions of interest for both 2.5 and 14 MeV neutrons. Activation coefficients (reaction rates) have been calculated using the neutron flux spectra at JET vacuum vessel, both for DD and DT plasmas, calculated by MCNP in the required 640-energy group format. The related uncertainties for the JET neutron spectra are evaluated as well using the covariance data available in the library. These uncertainties are in general small, but not negligible when high accuracy is required in the determination of the fusion neutron yields.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 1963-2012 IEEE. R2SUNED is a code system implementing the mesh-based Rigorous-two-step method for shutdown dose rates calculations, making use of MCNP and ACAB codes. In addition to the most relevant features of state-of-the-art R2S systems, novel and unique features have been implemented in R2SUNED to overcome limitations common to the current mesh-based R2S implementations. One of particular interest is the cell-under-voxel approach intended to address most of the issues associated with the conventional averaging technique used in the neutron flux determination. The underlying idea is to identify the cells enclosed in each voxel and calculate the average value of the neutron flux within each cell fraction. Subsequently, the activation of each material, filling the cell delimited by the voxel, is calculated using the neutron flux evaluated in the corresponding cell. This capability enables to properly resolve the strong spatial gradients of the neutron flux independently of geometrical considerations. Another relevant feature is that a flexible decay gamma source sampling has been incorporated to assure an efficient decay gamma transport in a vast diversity of problems. A verification of R2SUNED has been addressed on the ITER computational shutdown dose rate benchmark. It is highlighted both the limitations of voxel averaged neutron flux standard approach, and the ability of R2SUNED to overcome this issue. The excellent agreement of the results with those obtained using a mesh matching perfectly the geometry tells that R2SUNED performs correctly. Finally, a description of the most representative applications carried out with R2SUNED is provided for fusion relevant facilities.},

In particular, the presence of resonances leads to the well-known self-shielding effect that complicates any procedure for obtaining group cross sections. The Bondarenko method for producing self-shielded group cross sections is widely used. For heterogeneous systems, the approach requires the use of an escape cross section that captures the probability that a neutron will leave a cell without interaction, and simple approximations are typically used for this purpose. Here we provide a concise derivation for how to determine group cross sections using the Bondarenko method with an extension to multi-region collision probability models. The accuracy of the method is demonstrated by comparing group cross sections derived this way with those produced by Monte Carlo simulations of thermal and fast spectrum reactors. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
