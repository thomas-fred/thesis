abstract = {W and W-alloys are among the primary candidate materials for plasma-facing components in the design of fusion reactors, particularly in high-heat-flux regions such as the divertor. Under neutron irradiation W undergoes transmutation to its near-neighbours in the periodic table. Additionally He and H are particles emitted from certain neutron-induced reactions, and this is particularly significant in fusion research since the presence of helium in a material can cause both swelling and a strong increase in brittleness. This paper presents the results of inventory burn-up calculations on pure W and gives quantitative estimates for He production rates in both a fusion-reactor environment and under conditions expected in the ITER experimental device. Transmutation reactions in possible alloying elements (Re, Ta, Ti and V), which could be used to reduce the brittleness of pure W, are also considered. Additionally, for comparison, the transmutation of other fusion-relevant materials, including Fe and SiC, are presented. {\textcopyright} 2011 IAEA, Vienna.},

abstract = {We update the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) analysis of global surface temperature change, compare alternative analyses, and address questions about perception and reality of global warming. Satellite-observed night lights are used to identify measurement stations located in extreme darkness and adjust temperature trends of urban and periurban stations for nonclimatic factors, verifying that urban effects on analyzed global change are small. Because the GISS analysis combines available sea surface temperature records with meteorological station measurements, we test alternative choices for the ocean data, showing that global temperature change is sensitive to estimated temperature change in polar regions where observations are limited. We use simple 12 month (and n × 12) running means to improve the information content in our temperature graphs. Contrary to a popular misconception, the rate of warming has not declined. Global temperature is rising as fast in the past decade as in the prior 2 decades, despite year-to-year fluctuations associated with the El Ni{\~{n}}o-La Ni{\~{n}}a cycle of tropical ocean temperature. Record high global 12 month running mean temperature for the period with instrumental data was reached in 2010.},

@article{Zheng2016,
abstract = {It has long been recognised that the shortage of external tritium sources for fusion reactors using D-T, the most promising fusion fuel, requires all such fusion power plants (FPP) to breed their own tritium. It is also recognised that the initial start-up of a fusion reactor will require several kilograms of tritium within a scenario in which radioactive decay, ITER and subsequent demonstrator reactors are expected to have consumed most of the known tritium stockpile. To circumvent this tritium fuel shortage and ultimately achieve steady-state operation for a FPP, it is essential to first accumulate sufficient tritium to compensate for loss due to decay and significant retention in the materials in order to start a new FPP. In this work, we propose to accumulate tritium starting from D-D fusion reactions, since D exists naturally in water, and to gradually build up the D-T plasma targeted in fusion reactor designs. There are two likely D-D fusion reaction channels, (1) D + D → T + p, and (2) D + D → He3 + n. The tritium can be generated via the reaction channel '(1)' and the 2.45 MeV neutrons from '(2)' react with lithium-6 in the breeding blanket to produce more tritium to be fed back into plasma fuel. Quantitative evaluations are conducted for two blanket concepts to assess the feasibility and suitability of this approach to FPP reactors. The preliminary results suggest that initial operation in D-D with continual feedback into the plasma of the tritium produced enables a fusion reactor designed solely for D-T operation to start-up in an acceptably short time-scale without the need for any external tritium source.},

abstract = {We present new phenomenological optical model potentials (OMPs) for neutrons and protons with incident energies from 1 keV up to 200 MeV, for (near-)spherical nuclides in the mass range 24 ≤ A ≤ 209. They are based on a smooth, unique functional form for the energy dependence of the potential depths, and on physically constrained geometry parameters. For the first time, this enables one to predict basic scattering observables over a broad mass range and over an energy range that covers several orders of magnitude in MeV. Thereby, the necessity of using different OMPs in different energy regions has been removed. Using extensive grid searches and a new computational steering technique, we have obtained optical model parameters for many isotopes separately. We recommend that the resulting, so-called local, optical models be used in theoretical analyses of nuclear data. From these parameterizations, we have also constructed asymmetry-dependent neutron and proton global OMPs that are superior to all other existing phenomenological ones, not only with respect to the description of observables, but also as they cover larger mass and energy ranges. These (nucleon) global OMPs, we believe, may be used with some confidence in other studies whenever one of our local OMPs does not exist. To constrain our parameterization as much as possible and to assess the performance of our OMPs, we have compared our calculated results with an extensive experimental data set. This data set includes average resonance parameters, total and non-elastic cross sections, elastic scattering angular distributions and analyzing powers. The numerous local OMPs we have obtained allow us to disentangle asymmetry, Coulomb correction and mass-dependent components of our global OMPs. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {range investigated, one finds that there are about 1.2 neutrons in coincidence with every proton from carbon. The fact that this is greater than unity could be explained by poor statistics, or by the fact that the solid angle subtended by the neutron counter is no doubt due to a lead housing surrounding it.

In this paper, we evaluate that study and find significant shortcomings in the analysis. In particular, we point out that this work used invalid modeling tools, contained modeling errors, and made implausible and inadequately supported assumptions.

abstract = {The precise value of the mean neutron lifetime, {\$}\backslashtau{\_}n{\$}, plays an important role in nuclear and particle physics and cosmology. It is a key input for predicting the ratio of protons to helium atoms in the primordial universe and is used to search for new physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. There is a 3.9 standard deviation discrepancy between {\$}\backslashtau{\_}n{\$} measured by counting the decay rate of free neutrons in a beam (887.7 {\$}\backslashpm{\$} 2.2 s) and by counting surviving ultracold neutrons stored for different holding times in a material trap (878.5 {\$}\backslashpm{\$} 0.8 s). The experiment described here eliminates loss mechanisms present in previous trap experiments by levitating polarized ultracold neutrons above the surface of an asymmetric storage trap using a repulsive magnetic field gradient so that the stored neutrons do not interact with material trap walls and neutrons in quasi-stable orbits rapidly exit the trap. As a result of this approach and the use of a new in situ neutron detector, the lifetime reported here (877.7 {\$}\backslashpm{\$} 0.7 (stat) +0.3/-0.1 (sys) s) is the first measurement of {\$}\backslashtau{\_}n{\$} that does not require corrections larger than the quoted uncertainties.},

Controlled nuclear fusion toward ultimate energy sources for human beings has been being developed intensively worldwide for this half a century. A fusion power plant is free from concern of exhaustion of fuels and production of CO2. Therefore it has very attractive potential to be eternal fundamental energy sources and will contribute to resolving problems of climate change. On the other hand, unresolved issues in physics and engineering still remain. It will take another several decades to realize a fusion power plant by integration of advanced science and engineering such as control of high-temperature plasma exceeding 100 million degrees in Celsius and breeding technology of tritium by generated neutrons. The research and development has just entered the phase of engineering demonstration to extract 500 MW of thermal energy from fusion reaction in the 2020s. The demonstration of electric power generation is targeted before 2040.},

It provides an integrated view of cli- mate change as the final part of the IPCCs Fourth Assessment Re- port (AR4). Topic 1 summarises observed changes in climate and their ef- fects on natural and human systems, regardless of their causes, while Topic 2 assesses the causes of the observed changes. Topic 3 pre- sents projections of future climate change and related impacts un- der different scenarios. Topic 4 discusses adaptation and mitigation options over the next few decades and their interactions with sustainable develop- ment. Topic 5 assesses the relationship between adaptation and mitigation on a more conceptual basis and takes a longer-term per- spective. Topic 6 summarises the major robust findings and remain- ing key uncertainties in this assessment. A schematic framework representing anthropogenic drivers, impacts of and responses to climate change, and their linkages, is shown in Figure I.1. At the time of the Third Assessment Report (TAR) in 2001, information was mainly available to describe the linkages clockwise, i.e. to derive climatic changes and impacts from socio-economic information and emissions. With increased under- standing of these linkages, it is now possible to assess the linkages also counterclockwise, i.e. to evaluate possible development path- ways and global emissions constraints that would reduce the risk of future impacts that society may wish to avoid.},

@article{Markandya2007,
abstract = {The provision of electricity has been a great benefit to society, particularly in health terms, but it also carries health costs. Comparison of different forms of commercial power generation by use of the fuel cycle methods developed in European studies shows the health burdens to be greatest for power stations that most pollute outdoor air (those based on lignite, coal, and oil). The health burdens are appreciably smaller for generation from natural gas, and lower still for nuclear power. This same ranking also applies in terms of greenhouse-gas emissions and thus, potentially, to long-term health, social, and economic effects arising from climate change. Nuclear power remains controversial, however, because of public concern about storage of nuclear waste, the potential for catastrophic accident or terrorist attack, and the diversion of fissionable material for weapons production. Health risks are smaller for nuclear fusion, but commercial exploitation will not be achieved in time to help the crucial near-term reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions. The negative effects on health of electricity generation from renewable sources have not been assessed as fully as those from conventional sources, but for solar, wind, and wave power, such effects seem to be small; those of biofuels depend on the type of fuel and the mode of combustion. Carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and storage is increasingly being considered for reduction of CO2emissions from fossil fuel plants, but the health effects associated with this technology are largely unquantified and probably mixed: efficiency losses mean greater consumption of the primary fuel and accompanying increases in some waste products. This paper reviews the state of knowledge regarding the health effects of different methods of generating electricity. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {National demand for electricity follows a regular and predictable daily pattern. This pattern is set to change due to efficiency improvements, de-industrialisation and electrification of heat and transport. These changes are independent of renewable infeed and are not well understood: Contemporary studies assume that electricity load curves will retain their current shape, scaling equally in all hours. Changes to this shape will profoundly affect the electricity industry: Increasing the requirements for flexible and peaking capacity, and reducing asset utilisation and profitability. This paper explores the evolution of load curves to 2050 in Germany and Britain: Two countries undergoing radically different energy transformations. It reviews recent developments in Europe's electricity demand, and introduces two models for synthesising future hourly load curves: ELOAD (electricity LOad curve ADjustment) and DESSTinEE (Demand for Energy Services, Supply and Transmission in EuropE). Both models are applied to a decarbonisation scenario for 2050, and consistently show peak loads increasing by about 23{\%} points above the change in annual demand, to 103 GW in Germany and 92 GW in Britain. Sensitivities around electrification show that a million extra heat pumps or electric vehicles add up to 1.5 GW to peak demand. The structure and shape of the future load curves are analysed, and impacts on the national electricity systems are drawn.},

The effect of anthropogenic forcings can be detected in extreme precipitation observations, both individually and when simultaneously estimating anthropogenic and naturally forced changes. The effect of natural forcings is not detectable. We estimate that human influence has intensified annual maximum 1 day precipitation in sampled Northern Hemisphere locations by 3.3{\%} [1.1{\%} to 5.8{\%}, {\textgreater}90{\%} confidence interval] on average. This corresponds to an average intensification in RX1day of 5.2{\%} [1.3{\%}, 9.3{\%}] per degree increase in observed global mean surface temperature consistent with the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship.},

abstract = {As nuclear fusion progresses towards a sustainable energy source and the power of tokamak devices increases, a greater understanding of the radiation fields will be required. As well as on-load radiation fields, off-load or shutdown radiation field are an important consideration for the safety and economic viability of a commercial fusion reactor. Previously codes such as MCR2S have been written in order to predict the shutdown dose rates within, and in regions surrounding, a fusion reactor. MCR2S utilises a constructive solid geometry (CSG) model and a superimposed structured mesh to calculate 3-D maps of the shutdown dose rate. A new approach to MCR2S calculations is proposed and implemented using a single unstructured mesh to replace both the CSG model and the superimposed structured mesh. This new MCR2S approach has been demonstrated on three models of increasing complexity. These models were: a sphere, the ITER computational shutdown dose rate benchmark and the DEMO computational shutdown dose rate benchmark. In each case the results were compared to MCR2S calculations performed using MCR2S with CSG geometry and a superimposed structured mesh. It was concluded that the results from the unstructured mesh implementation of MCR2S compared well to the CSG structured mesh calculations. It was found that the resolution of the unstructured mesh can significantly affect the results of the calculations, and therefore it is important to finely mesh components with streaming paths or significantly contribute to the dose rate in the areas of interest. Although computationally more expensive it was found that there are some clear advantages when using unstructured meshes with MCR2S calculations which are outlined in this paper.},

In particular, the presence of resonances leads to the well-known self-shielding effect that complicates any procedure for obtaining group cross sections. The Bondarenko method for producing self-shielded group cross sections is widely used. For heterogeneous systems, the approach requires the use of an escape cross section that captures the probability that a neutron will leave a cell without interaction, and simple approximations are typically used for this purpose. Here we provide a concise derivation for how to determine group cross sections using the Bondarenko method with an extension to multi-region collision probability models. The accuracy of the method is demonstrated by comparing group cross sections derived this way with those produced by Monte Carlo simulations of thermal and fast spectrum reactors. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The total cross section and the differential cross section for the inelastic scattering of neutrons are considered. It is assumed that the compound nucleus is sufficiently excited so that the statistical model may be applied. If the statistical model may be applied as well to the residual nucleus, it is shown that the angular distribution of the inelastically scattered neutrons is isotropic. If only a few levels of the target nucleus can be excited, the angular distribution is anisotropic. Tables are provided which permit the calculation of the angular distribution if the incident and emergent neutron angular momenta are less than or equal to 3ℏ. Examples of the evaluation of total cross sections are given, providing examples of the sensitivity of the results to the quantum numbers of the excited state.},

@article{Kodeli2001,
abstract = {In the nuclear industry, an increased demand exists to provide modeling results with credible confidence bounds not only for simple but also for refined modeling. With the objective to facilitate and promote such analysis, a user-friendly and complete computer code package was developed comprising the multidimensional cross-section sensitivity and uncertainty code package SUSD3D, the secondary angular distribution (SAD) covariance data-processing module ERRORR34, and the cross-section covariance matrix library ZZ-VITAMIN-J/COVA. The discrete ordinates sensitivity formulation of the first-order perturbation theory is implemented in the SUSD3D code. Much effort was devoted to mitigate some drawbacks of the discrete ordinates-based sensitivity analysis, in particular to allow the analysis of complex geometries and to reduce memory requirements. The SUSD3D code is linked via interface files to a wide range of state-of-the-art transport codes suitable for complex radiation transport and facility design studies (like ANISN, DOT-3.5, DANTSYS, DORT, and TORT) and supports the new cross-section and covariance data formats. The SAD and secondary energy distribution effects can be taken into account. The complete SAD covariance matrices, as available in the European Fusion File evaluations (EFF-2 and -3) can be treated. The computer codes are written in FORTRAN-77 and run under DOS (PC), UNIX (workstations), VMS (VAX), and other compatible operating systems. The code system is extensively used to study fission- and fusion-related problems. The validation and several practical applications of the package are presented, including the reactor pressure vessel surveillance uncertainty studies, and ASPIS-iron, VENUS-3, and FNG benchmark experiment analyses.},

@article{Capote2009,
abstract = {We describe the physics and data included in the Reference Input Parameter Library, which is devoted to input parameters needed in calculations of nuclear reactions and nuclear data evaluations. Advanced modelling codes require substantial numerical input, therefore the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has worked extensively since 1993 on a library of validated nuclear-model input parameters, referred to as the Reference Input Parameter Library (RIPL). A final RIPL coordinated research project (RIPL-3) was brought to a successful conclusion in December 2008, after 15 years of challenging work carried out through three consecutive IAEA projects. The RIPL-3 library was released in January 2009, and is available on the Web through http://www-nds.iaea.org/RIPL-3/. This work and the resulting database are extremely important to theoreticians involved in the development and use of nuclear reaction modelling (ALICE, EMPIRE, GNASH, UNF, TALYS) both for theoretical research and nuclear data evaluations. The numerical data and computer codes included in RIPL-3 are arranged in seven segments: MASSES contains ground-state properties of nuclei for about 9000 nuclei, including three theoretical predictions of masses and the evaluated experimental masses of Audi et al. (2003). DISCRETE LEVELS contains 117 datasets (one for each element) with all known level schemes, electromagnetic and $\gamma$-ray decay probabilities available from ENSDF in October 2007. NEUTRON RESONANCES contains average resonance parameters prepared on the basis of the evaluations performed by Ignatyuk and Mughabghab. OPTICAL MODEL contains 495 sets of phenomenological optical model parameters defined in a wide energy range. When there are insufficient experimental data, the evaluator has to resort to either global parameterizations or microscopic approaches. Radial density distributions to be used as input for microscopic calculations are stored in the MASSES segment. LEVEL DENSITIES contains phenomenological parameterizations based on the modified Fermi gas and superfluid models and microscopic calculations which are based on a realistic microscopic single-particle level scheme. Partial level densities formulae are also recommended. All tabulated total level densities are consistent with both the recommended average neutron resonance parameters and discrete levels. GAMMA contains parameters that quantify giant resonances, experimental gamma-ray strength functions and methods for calculating gamma emission in statistical model codes. The experimental GDR parameters are represented by Lorentzian fits to the photo-absorption cross sections for 102 nuclides ranging from51V to239Pu. FISSION includes global prescriptions for fission barriers and nuclear level densities at fission saddle points based on microscopic HFB calculations constrained by experimental fission cross sections. {\textcopyright} 2009.},

abstract = {Neutron measurements using neutron activation systems are an essential part of the diagnostic system at large fusion machines such as JET and ITER. Nuclear data is used to infer the neutron yield. Consequently, high-quality nuclear data is essential for the proper determination of the neutron yield and fusion power. However, uncertainties due to nuclear data are not fully taken into account in uncertainty analysis for neutron yield calibrations using activation foils. This paper investigates the neutron yield uncertainty due to nuclear data using the so-called Total Monte Carlo Method. The work is performed using a detailed MCNP model of the JET fusion machine; the uncertainties due to the cross-sections and angular distributions in JET structural materials, as well as the activation cross-sections in the activation foils, are analysed. It is found that a significant contribution to the neutron yield uncertainty can come from uncertainties in the nuclear data. {\textcopyright} The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2017.},

abstract = {The ENDF/B-VII.1 library is our latest recommended evaluated nuclear data file for use in nuclear science and technology applications, and incorporates advances made in the five years since the release of ENDF/B-VII.0. These advances focus on neutron cross sections, covariances, fission product yields and decay data, and represent work by the US Cross Section Evaluation Working Group (CSEWG) in nuclear data evaluation that utilizes developments in nuclear theory, modeling, simulation, and experiment. The principal advances in the new library are: (1) An increase in the breadth of neutron reaction cross section coverage, extending from 393 nuclides to 423 nuclides; (2) Covariance uncertainty data for 190 of the most important nuclides, as documented in companion papers in this edition; (3) R-matrix analyses of neutron reactions on light nuclei, including isotopes of He, Li, and Be; (4) Resonance parameter analyses at lower energies and statistical high energy reactions for isotopes of Cl, K, Ti, V, Mn, Cr, Ni, Zr and W; (5) Modifications to thermal neutron reactions on fission products (isotopes of Mo, Tc, Rh, Ag, Cs, Nd, Sm, Eu) and neutron absorber materials (Cd, Gd); (6) Improved minor actinide evaluations for isotopes of U, Np, Pu, and Am (we are not making changes to the major actinides235,238U and239Pu at this point, except for delayed neutron data and covariances, and instead we intend to update them after a further period of research in experiment and theory), and our adoption of JENDL-4.0 evaluations for isotopes of Cm, Bk, Cf, Es, Fm, and some other minor actinides; (7) Fission energy release evaluations; (8) Fission product yield advances for fission-spectrum neutrons and 14 MeV neutrons incident on239Pu; and (9) A new decay data sublibrary. Integral validation testing of the ENDF/B-VII.1 library is provided for a variety of quantities: For nuclear criticality, the VII.1 library maintains the generally-good performance seen for VII.0 for a wide range of MCNP simulations of criticality benchmarks, with improved performance coming from new structural material evaluations, especially for Ti, Mn, Cr, Zr and W. For Be we see some improvements although the fast assembly data appear to be mutually inconsistent. Actinide cross section updates are also assessed through comparisons of fission and capture reaction rate measurements in critical assemblies and fast reactors, and improvements are evident. Maxwellian-averaged capture cross sections at 30 keV are also provided for astrophysics applications. We describe the cross section evaluations that have been updated for ENDF/B-VII.1 and the measured data and calculations that motivated the changes, and therefore this paper augments the ENDF/B-VII.0 publication. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Conditions necessary to achieve deuterium-tritium fuel self-sufficiency in fusion reactors are derived through extensive modeling and calculations of the required and achievable tritium breeding ratios as functions of the many reactor parameters and candidate design concepts. It is found that the excess margin in the breeding potential is not sufficient to cover all present uncertainties. Thus, the goal of attaining fuel self-sufficiency significantly restricts the allowable parameter space and design concepts. For example, the required breeding ratio can be reduced by (a) attaining high tritium fractional burnup, {\textgreater}5{\%}, in the plasma, (b) achieving very high reliability, {\textgreater}99{\%}, and very short times, {\textless}1 day, to fix failures in the tritium processing system, and (c) ensuring that nonradioactive decay losses from all subsystems are extremely low, e.g., {\textless}0.1 {\%} for the plasma exhaust processing system.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} Owned by the authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2010. Evaluated nuclear data rather than raw experimental and theoretical information are employed in nuclear applications such as the design of nuclear energy systems. Therefore, the process by which such information is produced and ultimately used is of critical interest to the nuclear science community. This paper provides an overview of various contemporary methods employed to generate evaluated cross sections and related physical quantities such as particle emission angular distributions and energy spectra. The emphasis here is on data associated with neutron induced reaction processes, with consideration of the uncertainties in these data, and on the more recent evaluation methods, e.g., those that are based on stochastic (Monte Carlo) techniques. There is no unique way to perform such evaluations, nor are nuclear data evaluators united in their opinions as to which methods are superior to the others in various circumstances. In some cases it is not critical which approaches are used as long as there is consistency and proper use is made of the available physical information. However, in other instances there are definite advantages to using particular methods as opposed to other options. Some of these distinctions are discussed in this paper and suggestions are offered regarding fruitful areas for future research in the development of evaluation methodology.},

This study curates historical reactor-specific overnight construction cost (OCC) data that broaden the scope of study substantially, covering the full cost history for 349 reactors in the US, France, Canada, West Germany, Japan, India, and South Korea, encompassing 58{\%} of all reactors built globally. We find that trends in costs have varied significantly in magnitude and in structure by era, country, and experience. In contrast to the rapid cost escalation that characterized nuclear construction in the United States, we find evidence of much milder cost escalation in many countries, including absolute cost declines in some countries and specific eras. Our new findings suggest that there is no inherent cost escalation trend associated with nuclear technology.},

abstract = {Conceptual design activities of the first fusion power plants were launched in recent years with a view to putting them into operation by 2050. Nuclear fusion offers significant benefits in comparison with exploited energy sources, especially limitless fuel reserves, inherent nuclear safety, and negligible impact on the environment. The challenge is a high heat and neutron loading of the fusion reactors nuclear zone. The paper brings the ex-ante economic analysis of the fusion power plant model DEMO2 in terms of the cost of electricity. The model investment and operating costs are presented. The limit sales price of electricity was found using the net present value method. The levelized cost of electricity LCOE method with the inclusion of external costs is used for a comparison of selected power plant types based on the OECD statistical data and the EU ExternE project results. The comparison shows the levelized cost of electricity of fusion power plants competitive to the actual renewable resources. After internalisation of external costs, the fusion power plants should become even the second cheapest power source.},

The direct cost of electricity of a fusion power plant and its key dependencies on the physics and technology assumptions, are calculated, as are the materials requirements. The other important aspect of costs, the external costs which can arise from effects such as pollution, accidents and waste are also given. Fusion is found to offer the prospect of a new energy source with acceptable direct costs and very low external costs. This places fusion in a strong position in a future energy market, especially one in which environmental constraints become increasingly important. {\textcopyright} 2005 D.J. Ward.

abstract = {The tritium required for ITER will be supplied from the CANDU production in Ontario, but while Ontario may be able to supply 8 kg for a DEMO fusion reactor in the mid-2050s, it will not be able to provide 10 kg at any realistic starting time. The tritium required to start DEMO will depend on advances in plasma fuelling efficiency, burnup fraction, and tritium processing technology. It is in theory possible to start up a fusion reactor with little or no tritium, but at an estimated cost of {\$}2 billion per kilogram of tritium saved, it is not economically sensible. Some heavy water reactor tritium production scenarios with varying degrees of optimism are presented, with the assumption that only Canada, the Republic of Korea, and Romania make tritium available to the fusion community. Results for the tritium available for DEMO in 2055 range from zero to 30 kg. CANDU and similar heavy water reactors could in theory generate additional tritium in a number of ways: (a) adjuster rods containing lithium could be used, giving 0.13 kg per year per reactor; (b) a fuel bundle with a burnable absorber has been designed for CANDU reactors, which might be adapted for tritium production; (c) tritium production could be increased by 0.05 kg per year per reactor by doping the moderator with lithium-6. If a fusion reactor is started up around 2055, governments in Canada, Argentina, China, India, South Korea and Romania will have the opportunity in the years leading up to that to take appropriate steps: (a) build, refurbish or upgrade tritium extraction facilities; (b) extend the lives of heavy water reactors, or build new ones; (c) reduce tritium sales; (d) boost tritium production in the remaining heavy water reactors. All of the alternative production methods considered have serious economic and regulatory drawbacks, and the risk of diversion of tritium or lithium-6 would also be a major concern. There are likely to be serious problems with supplying tritium for future fusion reactors.},

abstract = {Nuclear data are of fundamental importance in studies of nuclear technology. In these studies, experiments to measure cross sections and decay properties and simulations of the design of fission power plants, fusion devices and accelerators are included. The large amount of data required is stored in computer readable formats in data libraries and the most common of these are the general purpose files used for neutronics or transport calculations. These files also contain the standards against which most measurements are made. The other class of libraries are the special purpose ones containing decay data, fission yields and cross section data for dosimetry and activation. This paper gives examples of what data are available and describes their use for various fusion applications. The focus will be on neutron-induced activation data with examples of how the reactions of particular importance can be identified. All data should be accompanied by estimates of the uncertainty. This is best achieved by including covariance data; however, this is extremely challenging and only a subset of the available data has such uncertainty data. The general principles of how covariance matrices are used are outlined. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Therefore return of beryllium into the production cycle (recycling) will be necessary. The beryllium ore from some main deposits has uranium content inadmissible for fusion reactors. This fact raises a question on the need to develop and apply an economically acceptable technology for beryllium purification from the uranium.

Bremsstrahlung losses for all of these fueis have been calculated in a general fashion which applies not only to IEC systems but also to most other fusion schemes; these calculations indicate that bremsstrahlung losses will be prohibitively large for 3He-3He, p-lB, and p-6Li reactors and will be a considerable fraction of the fusion power for D-sHe and D-D reactors. Further calculations show that it d{\&}not -ap{\&}r possible for the dense central region of a reactor-grade IEC device to maintain significantly non-Maxwe{\%}in ion distributions or to keep two different ion species at significantly different temperatures, in contradiction with earlier claims made about such systems. Since the ions form a Maxwellian distribution with a mean energy. not very much smaller than iihe electrostatic well depth, ions in the energetic tail of the distribution will be lost at rates greatly in excess of the fusion rate. Even by using one of the best electron confinement systems proposed for such devices, a polyhedral cusp magnetic field, and by making exceedingly optimistic assumptions about the performance of that confinement system, the electron losses from the machine prove to be intolerable for all fuels except perhaps DT. In order for IEC systems to be used as fusion reactors,it will be necessary to find methods to circumvent these problems.},

abstract = {Beryllium is expected to be one of the materials used in DEMO-type fusion power plants as blanket neutron multiplier for solid breeders and also in ITER as protective layer of plasma facing components. Among the aspects to be considered when dealing with Be a relevant one is its impurities content. One of the impurity reported by manufacturers is uranium, and that could represent a main source of concern, because its irradiation under fusion neutrons will lead to the formation of actinides, such as plutonium. The paper presents a parametric assessment utilizing for beryllium material composition a range of possible U impurity content between 0 and 100 ppmwt. First Wall neutron wall load ranging from 0.5 to 2.2MW/m2and neutron fluence from 0.5 to 10.5MWyear/m2are considered (for ITER and DEMO-type reactor, respectively) to estimate the Pu production. In all those analyses the irradiation scenarios considered are based on a deuterium-tritium plasma. The evaluation have been performed using the EASY-2007 activation code package, with the EAF2007 activation library. An estimate of the Pu production at the end of the ITER fusion machine preliminary operation with deuterium-deuterium plasma is also presented. A preliminary analysis of the regulatory constraints on the maximum Pu production and indications of possible way for its minimisation is presented and discussed in the paper. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The study to date has mainly involved establishing the overall nature of the Anthropocene as a potential chronostratigraphic/geochronologic unit, and exploring the stratigraphic proxies, including several that are novel in geology, that might be applied to its characterization and definition. A preliminary summary of evidence and interim recommendations was presented by the Working Group at the 35th International Geological Congress in Cape Town, South Africa, in August 2016, together with results of voting by members of the AWG indicating the current balance of opinion on major questions surrounding the Anthropocene. The majority opinion within the AWG holds the Anthropocene to be stratigraphically real, and recommends formalization at epoch/series rank based on a mid-20th century boundary. Work is proceeding towards a formal proposal based upon selection of an appropriate Global boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP), as well as auxiliary stratotypes.

abstract = {Late Pleistocene extinctions are of interest to paleontological and anthropological research. In North America and Australia, human occupation occurred during a short period of time and overexploitation may have led to the extinction of mammalian megafauna. In northern Eurasia megafaunal extinctions are believed to have occurred over a relatively longer period of time, perhaps as a result of changing environmental conditions, but the picture is much less clear. To consider megafaunal extinction in Eurasia, we compare differences in the geographical distribution and commonness of extinct and extant species between paleontological and archaeological localities from the late middle Pleistocene to Holocene. Purely paleontological localities, as well as most extinct species, were distributed north of archaeological sites and of the extant species, suggesting that apart from possible differences in adaptations between humans and other species, humans could also have a detrimental effect on large mammal distribution. However, evidence for human overexploitation applies only to the extinct steppe bison Bison priscus. Other human-preferred species survive into the Holocene, including Rangifer tarandus, Equus ferus, Capreolus capreolus, Cervus elaphus, Equus hemionus, Saiga tatarica, and Sus scrofa. Mammuthus primigenius and Megaloceros giganteus were rare in archaeological sites. Carnivores appear little influenced by human presence, although they become rarer in Holocene archaeological sites. Overall, the data are consistent with the conclusion that humans acted as efficient hunters selecting for the most abundant species. Our study supports the idea that the late Pleistocene extinctions were environmentally driven by climatic changes that triggered habitat fragmentation, species range reduction, and population decrease, after which human interference either by direct hunting or via indirect activities probably became critical. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Understanding species extinction is a major concern today, and past extinctions provide valuable lessons. Numerous mammal species became extinct in the Arctic at the end of the ice age, but it is unclear why. By comparing numbers of dated bones with climate records, we find that megafaunal species, like mammoth, horse, and bison, experienced boom and bust cycles during the ice age as they tracked rapid climate changes. For these species to persist, long-distance dispersal was necessary. Their extinction on the North Slope occurred as the ice age ended, because rising sea level severed dispersal routes and spreading peat simultaneously degraded range quality. This finding suggests that arctic mammals can be resilient to environmental changes but only if their habitats remain widely interconnected.Understanding the population dynamics of megafauna that inhabited the mammoth steppe provides insights into the causes of extinctions during both the terminal Pleistocene and today. Our study area is Alaska{\{}$\backslash$textquoteright{\}}s North Slope, a place where humans were rare when these extinctions occurred. After developing a statistical approach to remove the age artifacts caused by radiocarbon calibration from a large series of dated megafaunal bones, we compare the temporal patterns of bone abundance with climate records. Megafaunal abundance tracked ice age climate, peaking during transitions from cold to warm periods. These results suggest that a defining characteristic of the mammoth steppe was its temporal instability and imply that regional extinctions followed by population reestablishment from distant refugia were characteristic features of ice-age biogeography at high latitudes. It follows that long-distance dispersal was crucial for the long-term persistence of megafaunal species living in the Arctic. Such dispersal was only possible when their rapidly shifting range lands were geographically interconnected. The end of the last ice age was fatally unique because the geographic ranges of arctic megafauna became permanently fragmented after stable, interglacial climate engendered the spread of peatlands at the same time that rising sea level severed former dispersal routes.},

Digital Comprehensive Summaries of Uppsala Dissertations from the Faculty of Science and Technology 1315. 85 pp. Uppsala: Acta Universitatis Upsaliensis. ISBN 978-91-554-9407-0. For the successful deployment of advanced nuclear systems and optimization of current reactor designs, high quality nuclear data are required. Before nuclear data can be used in applications they must first be evaluated, tested and validated against a set of integral experiments, and then converted into formats usable for applications. The evaluation process in the past was usually done by using differential experimental data which was then complemented with nuclear model calculations. This trend is fast changing due to the increase in computational power and tremendous improvements in nuclear reaction models over the last decade. Since these models have uncertain inputs, they are normally calibrated using experimental data. However, these experiments are themselves not exact. Therefore, the calculated quantities of model codes such as cross sections and angular distributions contain uncertainties. Since nuclear data are used in reactor transport codes as input for simulations, the output of transport codes contain uncertainties due to these data as well. Quantifying these uncertainties is important for setting safety margins; for providing confidence in the interpretation of results; and for deciding where additional efforts are needed to reduce these uncertainties. Also, regulatory bodies are now moving away from conservative evaluations to best estimate calculations that are accompanied by uncertainty evaluations. In this work, the Total Monte Carlo (TMC) method was applied to study the impact of nuclear data uncertainties from basic physics to macroscopic reactor parameters for the European Lead Cooled Training Reactor (ELECTRA). As part of the work, nuclear data uncertainties of actinides in the fuel, lead isotopes within the coolant, and some structural materials have been investigated. In the case of the lead coolant it was observed that the uncertainty in the k eff and the coolant void worth (except in the case of},

MCNP6 is the result of five years of effort by the MCNP5 and MCNPX code development teams. These groups of people, residing in Los Alamos National Laboratory's (LANL) X Computational Physics Division, Monte Carlo Codes Group (XCP-3), and Decision Applications Division, Radiation Transport and Applications Team (D-5), respectively, have combined their code development efforts to produce the next evolution of MCNP. While maintenance and bug fixes will continue for MCNP5 1.60 and MCNPX 2.7.0 for upcoming years, new code development capabilities only will be developed and released in MCNP6. In fact, the initial release of MCNP6 contains 16 new features not previously found in either code. These new features include the abilities to import unstructured mesh geometries from the finite element code Abaqus, to transport photons down to 1.0 eV, to transport electrons down to 10.0 eV, to model complete atomic relaxation emissions, and to generate or read mesh geometries for use with the LANL discrete ordinates code Partisn. The first release of MCNP6, MCNP6 Beta 2, is now available through the Radiation Safety Information Computational Center, and the first production release is expected in calendar year 2012. High confidence in the MCNP6 code is based on its performance with the verification and validation test suites, comparisons to its predecessor codes, the regression test suite, its code development process, and the underlying high-quality nuclear and atomic databases.},

abstract = {In this work, the effects of neutron energy-group structures and resonance treatments on the main integral neutronic parameters are investigated in a fusion-fission hybrid reactor, which has a fast and a thermal blanket fuelling with ThO2. A D-T fusion neutron (14.1 MeV) is used as a neutron source. Fissile zone is cooled: (a) with light water for the moderated blanket and (b) with pressurized helium gas for the fast blanket. The neutronic parameters have been evaluated with and without a resonance treatment for the same blanket compositions for the sake of a consistent comparison. The study has shown that neutron reactions above a threshold energy in fast neutron groups are less sensitive to resonance treatment, such as 7Li(n,??n') T and 232Th(n,f). Neutron energy-group structures in the neutron libraries and description ef fusion neutron source spectrum mainly affect these reactions. On the other hand, neutron reactions in the resonance and thermal energy groups are sensitive to resonance treatment, such as 6Li(n,??) T and 232Th(n,??), depending on the resonance structures. In the fast blanket calculations, resonance-based errors are lower and neutron source based errors are higher than in the moderated blanket. Further-more, a correct description of the fusion neutron source spectrum over several neutron energy groups is essential to calculate fission reaction rates, fission heating density, fosile and fissile breeding rates and neutron leakage accurately. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The Fispact-II code, written in object-style Fortran, follows the evolution of material irradiated by neutrons, alphas, gammas, protons, or deuterons, and provides a wide range of derived radiological output quantities to satisfy most needs for nuclear applications. It can be used with any ENDF-compliant group library data for nuclear reactions, particle-induced and spontaneous fission yields, and radioactive decay (including but not limited to TENDL-2015, ENDF/B-VII.1, JEFF-3.2, JENDL-4.0u, CENDL-3.1 processed into fine-group-structure files, GEFY-5.2 and UKDD-16), as well as resolved and unresolved resonance range probability tables for self-shielding corrections and updated radiological hazard indices. The code has many novel features including: extension of the energy range up to 1 GeV; additional neutron physics including self-shielding effects, temperature dependence, thin and thick target yields; pathway analysis; and sensitivity and uncertainty quantification and propagation using full covariance data. The latest ENDF libraries such as TENDL encompass thousands of target isotopes. Nuclear data libraries for Fispact-II are prepared from these using processing codes PREPRO, NJOY and CALENDF. These data include resonance parameters, cross sections with covariances, probability tables in the resonance ranges, PKA spectra, kerma, dpa, gas and radionuclide production and energy-dependent fission yields, supplemented with all 27 decay types. All such data for the five most important incident particles are provided in evaluated data tables. The Fispact-II simulation software is described in detail in this paper, together with the nuclear data libraries. The Fispact-II system also includes several utility programs for code-use optimisation, visualisation and production of secondary radiological quantities. Included in the paper are summaries of results from the suite of verification and validation reports available with the code.},

To reduce the computational cost, fine group cross libraries are often down-sampled into broad group cross section libraries. Cross section data collapsing generally involves two steps: Firstly, the broad group structure has to be determined; secondly, a weighting scheme is used to evaluate the broad cross section library based on the fine group cross section data and the broad group structure. A common scheme is to average the fine group cross section weighted by the fine group flux. Cross section collapsing techniques have been intensively researched. However, most studies use a pre-determined group structure, open based on experience, to divide the neutron energy spectrum into thermal, epi-thermal, fast, etc. energy range. In this paper, a swarm intelligence algorithm, particle swarm optimization (PSO), is applied to optimize the broad group structure. A graph representation of the broad group structure determination problem is introduced. And the swarm intelligence algorithm is used to solve the graph model.

abstract = {This paper describes an improvement pertaining to the energy group structure of WIMS code in thermal lattices using Particle Swarm Optimization method. The 69 group WIMS cross section library for the specified energy structure is generated using NJOY data processing system. The integral parameters of thermal reactor lattices BAPL-UO 2 and TRX are calculated by WIMSD5 code using the generated library. These parameters are compared against the results of continuous energy MCNP-4C code and are served for evaluating the energy group structure. Minimization of the errors in integral parameters and multiplication factor is considered as the objective function. Calculation results show that for thermal reactor lattices where the enrichment of uranium is slight, the optimized energy group structure obtains more precise results comparing with the original WIMS structure. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Hogenbirk1991,
abstract = {The results are presented of a sensitivity and uncertainty analysis of a NET iron/water inboard shielding blanket using energy self-shielded cross sections. Coupled (n, ??) transport calculations were performed in an S8P3 approximation using cross sections derived from the European Fusion File in the 121-group GAM-II structure. Energy self-shielding was taken into account using the Bondarenko method. The results of this analysis are compared with a similar analysis in which infinite dilute cross sections were used. It is shown that the effect of energy self-shielding on the neutron flux in the coils of the NET design is considerable, whereas the ??-flux is hardly influenced at all. This causes the nuclear heating in the inboard coils to be increased by 13{\%}. The relative uncertainty in the nuclear heating due to uncertainties in the total cross sections of Fe, Cr and Ni decreases by 8{\%} when self-shielding is taken into account. In addition, the effects of uncertainties in the energy and angular distributions of the scattered neutrons (SED and SAD respectively) were studied. SED uncertainties appear to have only a minor effect. SAD uncertainties, however, are quite important for elastic scattering. It is therefore concluded that more attention should be paid to these SAD uncertainties. ?? 1991.},

In this respect, the present paper reports on sensitivity and uncertainty analyses for the EU HCLL Test Blanket Module (TBM) of ITER. Neutron flux spectra and tritium production rates have been calculated using MCNP with a modified version of the ITER Alite torus sector model with integrated TBMs. Sensitivities of such parameters to nuclear cross sections of isotopes contained in the TBM as well as in the ITER device have been calculated using the Monte Carlo code MCSEN. Uncertainties could be obtained by using existing covariance data of the important nuclear cross section files, mainly from ENDF/B-VI, SCALE6.0, but also from recent JEFF/EFF evaluations. Like in the HCLL mock-up experiment two positions at front and back of the TBM have been selected. In both cases the calculated uncertainties of the responses (tritium production rate, neutron flux) are in the range of 2-4{\%}. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper presents a general overview of nuclear data evaluation and its applications as developed at NRG, Petten. Based on concepts such as robustness, reproducibility and automation, modern calculation tools are exploited to produce original nuclear data libraries that meet the current demands on quality and completeness. This requires a system which comprises differential measurements, theory development, nuclear model codes, resonance analysis, evaluation, ENDF formatting, data processing and integral validation in one integrated approach. Software, built around the TALYS code, will be presented in which all these essential nuclear data components are seamlessly integrated. Besides the quality of the basic data and its extensive format testing, a second goal lies in the diversity of processing for different type of users. The implications of this scheme are unprecedented. The most important are:. 1. Complete ENDF-6 nuclear data files, in the form of the TENDL library, including covariance matrices, for many isotopes, particles, energies, reaction channels and derived quantities. All isotopic data files are mutually consistent and are supposed to rival those of the major world libraries.2. More exact uncertainty propagation from basic nuclear physics to applied (reactor) calculations based on a Monte Carlo approach: "Total" Monte Carlo (TMC), using random nuclear data libraries.3. Automatic optimization in the form of systematic feedback from integral measurements back to the basic data. This method of work also opens a new way of approaching the analysis of nuclear applications, with consequences in both applied nuclear physics and safety of nuclear installations, and several examples are given here. This applied experience and feedback is integrated in a final step to improve the quality of the nuclear data, to change the users vision and finally to orchestrate their integration into simulation codes. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

@phdthesis{Rising2012,
abstract = {The use of several uncertainty quantification and propagation methodologies is investigated in the context of the prompt fission neutron spectrum (PFNS) uncer- tainties and its impact on critical reactor assemblies. First, the first-order, linear Kalman filter is used as a nuclear data evaluation and uncertainty quantification tool combining available PFNS experimental data and a modified version of the Los Alamos (LA) model. The experimental covariance matrices, not generally given in the EXFOR database, are computed using the GMA methodology used by the IAEA to establish more appropriate correlations within each experiment. Then, using sys- tematics relating the LA model parameters across a suite of isotopes, the PFNS for both the uranium and plutonium actinides are evaluated leading to a new evaluation including cross-isotope correlations. Next, an alternative evaluation approach, the unified Monte Carlo (UMC) method, is studied for the evaluation of the PFNS for the n(0.5 MeV)239Pu fission reaction and compared to the Kalman filter. The UMC approach to nuclear data evaluation is implemented in a variety of ways to test con- vergence toward the Kalman filter results and to determine the nonlinearities present in the LA model. Ultimately, the UMC approach is shown to be comparable to the Kalman filter for a realistic data evaluation of the PFNS and is capable of captur- ing the nonlinearities present in the LA model. Next, the impact that the PFNS uncertainties have on important critical assemblies is investigated. Using the PFNS covariance matrices in the ENDF/B-VII.1 nuclear data library, the uncertainties of the effective multiplication factor, leakage, and spectral indices of the Lady Godiva and Jezebel critical assemblies are quantified. Using principal component analysis on the PFNS covariance matrices results in needing only 2–3 principal components to re- tain the PFNS uncertainties. Then, using the polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) on the uncertain output quantities, the stochastic collocation method (SCM) is used to compute the PCE coefficients. Compared to the “brute force” Monte Carlo forward propagation method, the PCE-SCM approach is shown to be capable of obtaining the same amount of output quantity uncertainty information with orders of magnitude computational savings. Finally, the uncertainties quantified in the correlated model parameters for the suite of uranium and plutonium actinides are propagated through the Big Ten and Flattop assemblies. In the case of the keff uncertainties in the Big Ten assembly, the uncorrelated PFNS uncertainties leads to 17.5{\%} smaller predicted uncertainties compared with the correlated PFNS uncertainties, suggesting the pres- ence of these cross-isotope correlations are important for this application. Last, the unified Monte Carlo + total Monte Carlo (UMC+TMC) method is implemented to propagate uncertainties from the prior LA model parameters through the Flattop critical assemblies. Due to the fact that cross-experiment correlations are neglected in all of the present evaluation work, the UMC+TMC suffers by predicting smaller uncertainties in the integral quantities by an order of magnitude or more compared to direct sampling from the posterior LA model parameters.},

abstract = {The modeling of the component material composition during and after the fusion energy power plant's operational lifetime is required for radiation protection, fuel cycle, radioactive waste disposal and reactor performance. The computational load and accuracy of the models are dependant on the method of reaction rate calculation. The generation of reaction rates within Monte-Carlo (MC) transport codes can be accomplished via (1) the standard point-wise estimator approach of tallying the pointwise flux and pointwise partial cross sections and/or (2) the multigroup approach which convolves a pointwise neutron flux with pre-defined binned partial cross-sections. Even fine multigroup sampling is more efficient when compared to pointwise Monte-Carlo sampling due to the removal of the cross-section interpolation from the calculation. This paper describes the four stage optimization procedure used to find an energy binning format which enables an accurate enough and computationally efficient calculation of any reaction rate when applied to MC modeling of IFE/MFE devices. This optimum format, named FOMG (Fusion Optimised Multi-Group), was evaluated using a SINBAD (Shielding Integral Benchmark Archive Database) benchmark. Despite the number of multi-group bins exceeding the number of data elements for a significant number of the ENDF files the MCNP simulation took more than one hundred times longer to calculate reaction rates using the pointwise approach when compared to the multi-group method with FOMG structure.},

Much progress has been achieved in this area over the past decade, largely as result of the effort spent by the national fusion technology programmes in the EU, Japan, the RF and the US and supported by the international thermonuclear experimental reactor (ITER) project. In conjunction with the conduction of various integral benchmark experiments, this has led to the development of a well-qualified nuclear database for fusion applications, the international fusion evaluated nuclear data library (FENDL), and the assessment of safety margins derived for reactor design relevant responses. Further development work is required to enable direct uncertainty calculations for fusion reactor applications. This requires a Monte Carlo code capable for full sensitivity and uncertainty calculations along with high-quality, co-variance data as well as suitable integral benchmark experiments for qualification and validation purposes. This proceeding will allow specifying, by Monte Carlo calculations, the design relevant responses with their associated uncertainties and thus directly providing the related design safety margins.},

abstract = {The USITER Project is responsible for providing a generic design of 18 diagnostics upper port plugs (UPPs). These plugs are designed to provide effective nuclear shielding, adequate nuclear heat removal capability, and allowance for personnel accessibility shortly after shutdown. In addition, the design limits for other parameters should not be exceeded during ITER lifetime. This includes the accumulative DPA and helium production in the UPP structure and the vacuum vessel, fast neutron fluence reaching the neighboring TF and PF magnets, and the accumulative local heating in their coil casings. In the present work, we assess these performance characteristics in three generic upper port plug (GUPP) designs of the in-plug shield and labyrinths that span possible configurations ranging from a conservative to worst case. The cases considered are: (1) Case A: "Visible-IR Camera diagnostic" with an intact port-attached blanket shield module (BSM), and (2) Case B: vis/IR system where the port-based BSM is replaced by overlapping adjacent vessel-attached BSM and (3) Case C: a "Large Aperture diagnostic" that is loosely resembles ECH style shielding plugs and aperture. These cases were modeled in a 20-degree sector of ITER.

The primary objective of the experiment was to validate the MCNP calculations (C) of nuclear heating measured (E) in the region corresponding to the ITER Toroidal Field (TF) coil. An accuracy on C/E ratio of 10{\%} was required. The neutronics and shielding properties of the mock-up were also studied throughout the measurement of selected activation reaction rates up to about 1 m depth. Due to the very low activity induced in the foils, the measurements in the deepest experimental positions were performed at the underground low background facility of the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso, using ultra-low background high purity germanium (HPGe) detectors. The measured reaction rates and nuclear heating were thus compared with the results of the Monte Carlo code MCNP5 coupled with the FENDL-2.1 library. 2012 EURATOM ENEA Association.},

abstract = {An acceptable criterion for strong sustainability in the consumption of natural resources is an effective, or virtual, limitlessness of supply, which can be defined, albeit arbitrarily, as corresponding to a few million years. The fuels for nuclear fusion - lithium and deuterium - satisfy this condition because of the abundance of lithium in seawater and of deuterium in all forms of water. The possible use of lithium-ion batteries on a large scale, particularly in the automobile industry, could, however, use up all the known terrestrial reserves and resources of lithium in the next few decades. Little attention has been paid so far to the financial, energetic, and above all, environmental aspects of lithium extraction from seawater. The neutron multipliers foreseen for fusion power plants, in particular beryllium, represent a major supply problem and require that other, sustainable solutions be urgently sought. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {A neutronics experiment has been performed in the frame of European Fusion Technology Program on a mock-up of the EU Test Blanket Module (TBM), HCPB concept, with the objective to validate the capability of nuclear data to predict nuclear responses, such as the tritium production rate (TPR), with qualified uncertainties. In the experiment, the TPR has been measured using Li2CO3 pellets located at various depths at two symmetrical positions at each depth, one in the upper and one in the lower breeder cassette. Three independent measurements were performed by ENEA, TUD/VKTA and JAEA. The neutron flux in the beryllium layer was measured as well using activation foils. The measured tritium production in the TBM (E) was compared with the same quantity (C) calculated by the MCNP-4C code using a very detailed model of the experimental set up. A sensitivity and uncertainty analysis has also been performed to evaluate the calculation uncertainty due to the uncertainty on neutron cross sections. The results of such analysis, carried out using both Monte Carlo and deterministic codes, shows that the uncertainty due to cross sections amounts to 4-5{\%} (2$\sigma$). C/E ratios were obtained with a total uncertainty on the C/E comparison of 9-10{\%} (2$\sigma$). The C/E comparison shows that the calculation of the tritium production is underestimated by about 10{\%} in average and is within the combined 2$\sigma$ uncertainty margin of the measurements and the calculations. The obtained results indicate that design calculations of the tritium breeding ratio provide conservative results for the fusion reactor employing a HCPB type breeder blanket. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

From this, the efficiency of the fusion plant is predominated by the technologies applied to make electricity or hydrogen from the neutrons. The main blanket concepts addressed in this paper are advanced ceramic breeder concepts, dual coolant blankets as well as self-cooled liquid metal and Flibe blankets. Two important questions that are addressed are: (i) Can we draw a bottom line conclusion on the most promising concept(s)? (ii) What are the common issues to be resolved independently from individual design and layout proposals to define a feasible route towards advanced fusion reactors? For ceramic breeder concepts, a key issue in the long term could be the limitation of beryllium as the considered multiplier in terms of world sources and achievable temperature levels. For liquid metal blankets, attractive long-term visions have been developed but major technological challenges also exist for the in-vessel blanket technology and the corresponding sub-systems.
