abstract = {MCNP6 is simply and accurately described as the merger of MCNP5 and MCNPX capabilities, but it is much more than the sum of those two computer codes. MCNP6 is the result of five years of effort by the MCNP5 and MCNPX code development teams. These groups of people, residing in Los Alamos National Laboratory's (LANL) X Computational Physics Division, Monte Carlo Codes Group (XCP-3), and Decision Applications Division, Radiation Transport and Applications Team (D-5), respectively, have combined their code development efforts to produce the next evolution of MCNP. While maintenance and bug fixes will continue for MCNP5 1.60 and MCNPX 2.7.0 for upcoming years, new code development capabilities only will be developed and released in MCNP6. In fact, the initial release of MCNP6 contains 16 new features not previously found in either code. These new features include the abilities to import unstructured mesh geometries from the finite element code Abaqus, to transport photons down to 1.0 eV, to transport electrons down to 10.0 eV, to model complete atomic relaxation emissions, and to generate or read mesh geometries for use with the LANL discrete ordinates code Partisn. The first release of MCNP6, MCNP6 Beta 2, is now available through the Radiation Safety Information Computational Center, and the first production release is expected in calendar year 2012. High confidence in the MCNP6 code is based on its performance with the verification and validation test suites, comparisons to its predecessor codes, the regression test suite, its code development process, and the underlying high-quality nuclear and atomic databases.},

abstract = {The NJOY Nuclear Data Processing System is widely used to convert evaluations in the Evaluated Nuclear Data Files (ENDF) format into forms useful for practical applications such as fission and fusion reactor analysis, stockpile stewardship calculations, criticality safety, radiation shielding, nuclear waste management, nuclear medicine procedures, and more. This paper provides a description of the system's capabilities, summary descriptions of the methods used, and information on how to use the code to process the modern evaluated nuclear data files from ENDF/B-VII. It begins with the generation of pointwise libraries, including reaction and resonance reconstruction, Doppler broadening, radiation heating and damage, thermal scattering data, unresolved resonance data, and gas production. It then reviews the production of libraries for the continuous-energy Monte Carlo code MCNP, multigroup neutron, photon, and particle cross sections and matrices, and photon interaction data. The generation of uncertainty information for ENDF data is discussed, including new capabilities for calculating covariances of resonance data, angular distributions, energy distributions, and radioactive nuclide production. NJOY's ability to prepare thermal scattering data evaluations for bound moderators (which was used during the preparation of the ENDF/B-VII library) is described. The strong plotting capabilities of NJOY are summarized. Many examples of black{\&}white and color Postscript plots are included throughout the paper. The capabilities of NJOY to output multigroup data in several different formats to suit various applications is reviewed. Finally, a section is included that summarizes the history of the development of the NJOY system over the last 37 years. ?? 2010.},

In the current paper, the bilinear combination of forward and adjoint neutron spectra is used for the optimization of 69 energy group structure of WIMSD5 lattice physics code. To remedy the energy self-shielding effect, homogeneous adjoint and forward B{\textless}inf{\textgreater}N{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} equations on an ultrafine energy group structure have been solved to obtain the ultrafine forward and adjoint spectra. The coarse group intervals are selected to have equal values of bilinear function in each energy interval. In order to verify the validity of the optimized structure, infinite multiplication factor and fission rate values are calculated using WIMSD5 code for two main types of thermal critical lattices: Mixed Oxide (MOX) and Uranium Oxide (UOX). A Comparison of the results with MCNP-4C code shows that the optimized 69 group structure improves the infinite multiplication factor and fission rate in the mentioned thermal lattices.},

abstract = {In this work, the effects of neutron energy-group structures and resonance treatments on the main integral neutronic parameters are investigated in a fusion-fission hybrid reactor, which has a fast and a thermal blanket fuelling with ThO2. A D-T fusion neutron (14.1 MeV) is used as a neutron source. Fissile zone is cooled: (a) with light water for the moderated blanket and (b) with pressurized helium gas for the fast blanket. The neutronic parameters have been evaluated with and without a resonance treatment for the same blanket compositions for the sake of a consistent comparison. The study has shown that neutron reactions above a threshold energy in fast neutron groups are less sensitive to resonance treatment, such as 7Li(n,??n') T and 232Th(n,f). Neutron energy-group structures in the neutron libraries and description ef fusion neutron source spectrum mainly affect these reactions. On the other hand, neutron reactions in the resonance and thermal energy groups are sensitive to resonance treatment, such as 6Li(n,??) T and 232Th(n,??), depending on the resonance structures. In the fast blanket calculations, resonance-based errors are lower and neutron source based errors are higher than in the moderated blanket. Further-more, a correct description of the fusion neutron source spectrum over several neutron energy groups is essential to calculate fission reaction rates, fission heating density, fosile and fissile breeding rates and neutron leakage accurately. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

It is known that UO2 –PuO2 (MOX) is a recently developed fuel which consumes recycled plutonium. For such fuel which contains various resonant nuclides, the selection of energy group structure is more crucial comparing to the UO2 fuels. In this paper, in order to improve the accuracy of the integral results in MOX thermal lattices calculated by WIMSD-5B code, a swarm intelligence method is employed to optimize the energy group structure of WIMS library. In this process, the NJOY code system is used to generate the 69 group cross sections of WIMS code for the specified energy structure. In addition, the multiplication factor and spectral indices are compared against the results of continuous energy MCNP-4C code for evaluating the energy group structure. Calculations performed in four different types of H2 O moderated UO2 –PuO2 (MOX) lattices show that the optimized energy structure obtains more accurate results in comparison with the WIMS original structure.},

abstract = {Fispact-II is a code system and library database for modelling activation-transmutation processes, depletion-burn-up, time dependent inventory and radiation damage source terms caused by nuclear reactions and decays. The Fispact-II code, written in object-style Fortran, follows the evolution of material irradiated by neutrons, alphas, gammas, protons, or deuterons, and provides a wide range of derived radiological output quantities to satisfy most needs for nuclear applications. It can be used with any ENDF-compliant group library data for nuclear reactions, particle-induced and spontaneous fission yields, and radioactive decay (including but not limited to TENDL-2015, ENDF/B-VII.1, JEFF-3.2, JENDL-4.0u, CENDL-3.1 processed into fine-group-structure files, GEFY-5.2 and UKDD-16), as well as resolved and unresolved resonance range probability tables for self-shielding corrections and updated radiological hazard indices. The code has many novel features including: extension of the energy range up to 1 GeV; additional neutron physics including self-shielding effects, temperature dependence, thin and thick target yields; pathway analysis; and sensitivity and uncertainty quantification and propagation using full covariance data. The latest ENDF libraries such as TENDL encompass thousands of target isotopes. Nuclear data libraries for Fispact-II are prepared from these using processing codes PREPRO, NJOY and CALENDF. These data include resonance parameters, cross sections with covariances, probability tables in the resonance ranges, PKA spectra, kerma, dpa, gas and radionuclide production and energy-dependent fission yields, supplemented with all 27 decay types. All such data for the five most important incident particles are provided in evaluated data tables. The Fispact-II simulation software is described in detail in this paper, together with the nuclear data libraries. The Fispact-II system also includes several utility programs for code-use optimisation, visualisation and production of secondary radiological quantities. Included in the paper are summaries of results from the suite of verification and validation reports available with the code.},

abstract = {Multi-group theory is widely applied for the energy domain discretization when solving the Linear Boltzmann Equation. To reduce the computational cost, fine group cross libraries are often down-sampled into broad group cross section libraries. Cross section data collapsing generally involves two steps: Firstly, the broad group structure has to be determined; secondly, a weighting scheme is used to evaluate the broad cross section library based on the fine group cross section data and the broad group structure. A common scheme is to average the fine group cross section weighted by the fine group flux. Cross section collapsing techniques have been intensively researched. However, most studies use a pre-determined group structure, open based on experience, to divide the neutron energy spectrum into thermal, epi-thermal, fast, etc. energy range. In this paper, a swarm intelligence algorithm, particle swarm optimization (PSO), is applied to optimize the broad group structure. A graph representation of the broad group structure determination problem is introduced. And the swarm intelligence algorithm is used to solve the graph model. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated using a fuel-pin model. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In this respect, the present paper reports on sensitivity and uncertainty analyses for the EU HCLL Test Blanket Module (TBM) of ITER. Neutron flux spectra and tritium production rates have been calculated using MCNP with a modified version of the ITER Alite torus sector model with integrated TBMs. Sensitivities of such parameters to nuclear cross sections of isotopes contained in the TBM as well as in the ITER device have been calculated using the Monte Carlo code MCSEN. Uncertainties could be obtained by using existing covariance data of the important nuclear cross section files, mainly from ENDF/B-VI, SCALE6.0, but also from recent JEFF/EFF evaluations. Like in the HCLL mock-up experiment two positions at front and back of the TBM have been selected. In both cases the calculated uncertainties of the responses (tritium production rate, neutron flux) are in the range of 2-4{\%}. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The use of several uncertainty quantification and propagation methodologies is investigated in the context of the prompt fission neutron spectrum (PFNS) uncer- tainties and its impact on critical reactor assemblies. First, the first-order, linear Kalman filter is used as a nuclear data evaluation and uncertainty quantification tool combining available PFNS experimental data and a modified version of the Los Alamos (LA) model. The experimental covariance matrices, not generally given in the EXFOR database, are computed using the GMA methodology used by the IAEA to establish more appropriate correlations within each experiment. Then, using sys- tematics relating the LA model parameters across a suite of isotopes, the PFNS for both the uranium and plutonium actinides are evaluated leading to a new evaluation including cross-isotope correlations. Next, an alternative evaluation approach, the unified Monte Carlo (UMC) method, is studied for the evaluation of the PFNS for the n(0.5 MeV)239Pu fission reaction and compared to the Kalman filter. The UMC approach to nuclear data evaluation is implemented in a variety of ways to test con- vergence toward the Kalman filter results and to determine the nonlinearities present in the LA model. Ultimately, the UMC approach is shown to be comparable to the Kalman filter for a realistic data evaluation of the PFNS and is capable of captur- ing the nonlinearities present in the LA model. Next, the impact that the PFNS uncertainties have on important critical assemblies is investigated. Using the PFNS covariance matrices in the ENDF/B-VII.1 nuclear data library, the uncertainties of the effective multiplication factor, leakage, and spectral indices of the Lady Godiva and Jezebel critical assemblies are quantified. Using principal component analysis on the PFNS covariance matrices results in needing only 2–3 principal components to re- tain the PFNS uncertainties. Then, using the polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) on the uncertain output quantities, the stochastic collocation method (SCM) is used to compute the PCE coefficients. Compared to the “brute force” Monte Carlo forward propagation method, the PCE-SCM approach is shown to be capable of obtaining the same amount of output quantity uncertainty information with orders of magnitude computational savings. Finally, the uncertainties quantified in the correlated model parameters for the suite of uranium and plutonium actinides are propagated through the Big Ten and Flattop assemblies. In the case of the keff uncertainties in the Big Ten assembly, the uncorrelated PFNS uncertainties leads to 17.5{\%} smaller predicted uncertainties compared with the correlated PFNS uncertainties, suggesting the pres- ence of these cross-isotope correlations are important for this application. Last, the unified Monte Carlo + total Monte Carlo (UMC+TMC) method is implemented to propagate uncertainties from the prior LA model parameters through the Flattop critical assemblies. Due to the fact that cross-experiment correlations are neglected in all of the present evaluation work, the UMC+TMC suffers by predicting smaller uncertainties in the integral quantities by an order of magnitude or more compared to direct sampling from the posterior LA model parameters.},

abstract = {The modeling of the component material composition during and after the fusion energy power plant's operational lifetime is required for radiation protection, fuel cycle, radioactive waste disposal and reactor performance. The computational load and accuracy of the models are dependant on the method of reaction rate calculation. The generation of reaction rates within Monte-Carlo (MC) transport codes can be accomplished via (1) the standard point-wise estimator approach of tallying the pointwise flux and pointwise partial cross sections and/or (2) the multigroup approach which convolves a pointwise neutron flux with pre-defined binned partial cross-sections. Even fine multigroup sampling is more efficient when compared to pointwise Monte-Carlo sampling due to the removal of the cross-section interpolation from the calculation. This paper describes the four stage optimization procedure used to find an energy binning format which enables an accurate enough and computationally efficient calculation of any reaction rate when applied to MC modeling of IFE/MFE devices. This optimum format, named FOMG (Fusion Optimised Multi-Group), was evaluated using a SINBAD (Shielding Integral Benchmark Archive Database) benchmark. Despite the number of multi-group bins exceeding the number of data elements for a significant number of the ENDF files the MCNP simulation took more than one hundred times longer to calculate reaction rates using the pointwise approach when compared to the multi-group method with FOMG structure.},

abstract = {An overview is given of the achievements in the field of neutronics and nuclear data for fusion reactor applications. Much progress has been achieved in this area over the past decade, largely as result of the effort spent by the national fusion technology programmes in the EU, Japan, the RF and the US and supported by the international thermonuclear experimental reactor (ITER) project. In conjunction with the conduction of various integral benchmark experiments, this has led to the development of a well-qualified nuclear database for fusion applications, the international fusion evaluated nuclear data library (FENDL), and the assessment of safety margins derived for reactor design relevant responses. Further development work is required to enable direct uncertainty calculations for fusion reactor applications. This requires a Monte Carlo code capable for full sensitivity and uncertainty calculations along with high-quality, co-variance data as well as suitable integral benchmark experiments for qualification and validation purposes. This proceeding will allow specifying, by Monte Carlo calculations, the design relevant responses with their associated uncertainties and thus directly providing the related design safety margins.},

The mock-up dimensions and materials composition are consistent with the current ITER design. The primary objective of the experiment was to validate the MCNP calculations (C) of nuclear heating measured (E) in the region corresponding to the ITER Toroidal Field (TF) coil. An accuracy on C/E ratio ?????10{\%} was required. The neutronics and shielding properties of the mock-up were also studied throughout the measurement of selected activation reaction rates up to about 1 m depth. Due to the very low activity induced in the foils, the measurements in the deepest experimental positions were performed at the underground low background facility of the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso, using ultra-low background high purity germanium (HPGe) detectors. The measured reaction rates and nuclear heating were thus compared with the results of the Monte Carlo code MCNP5 coupled with the FENDL-2.1 library. ?? 2012 EURATOM ENEA Association.},

abstract = {The USITER Project is responsible for providing a generic design of 18 diagnostics upper port plugs (UPPs). These plugs are designed to provide effective nuclear shielding, adequate nuclear heat removal capability, and allowance for personnel accessibility shortly after shutdown. In addition, the design limits for other parameters should not be exceeded during ITER lifetime. This includes the accumulative DPA and helium production in the UPP structure and the vacuum vessel, fast neutron fluence reaching the neighboring TF and PF magnets, and the accumulative local heating in their coil casings. In the present work, we assess these performance characteristics in three generic upper port plug (GUPP) designs of the in-plug shield and labyrinths that span possible configurations ranging from a conservative to worst case. The cases considered are: (1) Case A: "Visible-IR Camera diagnostic" with an intact port-attached blanket shield module (BSM), and (2) Case B: vis/IR system where the port-based BSM is replaced by overlapping adjacent vessel-attached BSM and (3) Case C: a "Large Aperture diagnostic" that is loosely resembles ECH style shielding plugs and aperture. These cases were modeled in a 20-degree sector of ITER.
